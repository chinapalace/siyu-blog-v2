We&#39;re certainly still a bit hungover. In any case, here&#39;s to another&nbsp;long haul&nbsp;of briefs before we toot our own horn again. As promised today we&#39;ll be delving into some portfolio theory basics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, and we&#39;ll continue this next week, we&#39;re gonna try to provide some bullish sentiment for a change. However, if you don&#39;t want to get bogged down in interest rates for the umpteenth time and just want us to tell you some basics of how to approach a portfolio, we <strong>highly</strong> suggest you skip the first section.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:navy"><strong>10 Year Treasury Yield vs. Fed Funds Rate</strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">No, this subsection will not pit these two highly important market data points against each other in an octagon. Sorry to disappoint. Frequently we draw attention to the fact that we are likely in the late-stage of our cycle, with a recession looming somewhere down the road.

Also note how we haven&#39;t seen negative territory since before the last recession in 2008. With the Federal Funds Rate at 1.75% and the 10 Year yield around 3%, there&#39;s some cushion there yet. However, the Fed is still <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=4fd35bd09a&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">expected to bump it&#39;s key rate up 25 basis points&nbsp;two more times </span></a>this year, at which point it would be at 2.25%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, you can&#39;t hang your hat on one leading indicator alone and hope that it will warn you about any and all trouble in advance. For one, economies, and the variables that are most important in determining their expansions and contractions, change over time. Previously relevant metrics may become obsolete. Similarly, there&#39;s a whole host of other leading and coincident indicators that can be tracked to check economic health. A few fan favorites include measures of consumer credit, initial claims for unemployment insurance, and manufacturers&#39; new orders for consumer goods. </span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">We don&#39;t really have the space to dive into why this indicator has performed well in predicting periods of economic contraction.

A principal conclusion is that&nbsp;risk-averse investors can construct portfolios that optimize <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=ea04b0b418&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">expected return</span></a>&nbsp;for given levels of risk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&#39;s take a step back here, what is a portfolio? It&#39;s a collection of assets (not just stocks), such as 10 shares of Apple stock, 5 shares of Amazon, and 10 GE bonds. The weighted average of the asset&#39;s expected returns is the expected return of the portfolio. We&#39;ll dive more into calculations of risk for a portfolio later in this email, but for now it suffices to say that Markowitz positioned <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=b0f0404451&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">standard deviation</span></a> and variance (standard deviation squared) of returns as the risk metrics used in MPT. These are measures of <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=13ff18ca0e&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">dispersion</span></a>: they measure how concentrated or spread out the distribution of expected returns is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne key takeaway from MPT is that a portfolio of diversified assets (assets that don&#39;t &quot;act&quot; exactly the same as each other) can reduce the standard deviation of the portfolio without necessarily reducing the expected return. If you only hold one asset, your expected return and standard deviation of returns will simply equal the values of the asset. Portfolios consisting of many assets however can eliminate <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=fb403cab53&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">firm-specific risk</span></a>, though general <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=4e40cbbcc0&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">market risk </span></a>exposure will always be present. Total risk for an asset is the sum of specific risk and market risk; portfolios reduce total risk by eliminating or reducing specific risk.</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">MPT is all about constructing portfolios that optimize potential return for a given level of risk. One visualization of this concept is known as the efficient frontier, and is represented by the bowed section in the following, <strong>lovely</strong> chart. The efficient frontier consists of optimal portfolios that exhibit the highest levels of expected return for a given standard deviation (risk).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:gray; font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif; font-size:12pt; margin:0px"><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Markowitz_frontier.jpg" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; height:auto!important; outline:none; text-decoration:none" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">The other facet of this chart is the Capital Allocation Line (CAL), or the line that represents the various combinations of allocation between risky assets and risk-free-assets investors could use in constructing portfolios. The CAL is highly idealized insofar as it assumes that all investors invest in the same portfolio comprised of risky assets (&quot;the market portfolio&quot;). Investors differ only in how they weight the two portions of the total portfolio; heavier weightings of the risk-free-asset reduce the level of risk for relatively more risk averse investors, and vice versa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote how individual assets plot to the right, below the CAL. This indicates that while their expected returns may be high, they have higher standard deviations than points along the CAL. Equal expected returns could be achieved by investing along the CAL, rather than holding the individual assets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe CAL&#39;s slope is known as the &quot;reward to variability&quot; ratio. At a certain point, the CAL runs tangentially to the efficient frontier, thus creating the tangency portfolio.&nbsp;The tangency portfolio offers the largest risk adjusted expected return.</span><span style="color:gray"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:navy">Here Comes the Math</span></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">To understand how diversification can reduce portfolio risk without sacrificing expected return, we will examine the formula for the variance and standard deviation of a simple, equal-weighted two-asset portfolio. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="list-style-type:disc">\r\n\t<li><span style="color:black">Asset 1 = Equity with a standard deviation of returns of 10% (&sigma;1)</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:black">Weight of Asset 1 in Portfolio = 50% (w1)</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:black">Asset 2 = Risk-free Asset with a standard deviation of returns of 15% (&sigma;2)</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:black">Weight of Asset 2 in Portfolio = 50% (w2)</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:black"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=695d20b49c&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">Correlation </span></a>of the two assets =&nbsp;.75 (p)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">Portfolio variance = (w1)^2(&sigma;1)^2 + (w2)2(&sigma;2)2 + 2(p)(w1)(&sigma;1)(w2)(&sigma;2)<br />\r\nAnd, given that standard deviation is the square root of variance,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPortfolio standard deviation = {(w1)^2(&sigma;1)^2 + (w2)2(&sigma;2)2 + 2(p)(w1)(&sigma;1) (w2)(&sigma;2)}^(1/2)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor our purposes the portfolio&#39;s variance = (.5)^2(.1)^2 + (.5)^2(.15)^2 + 2(.75)(.5)(.1)(.5)(.15) = .01375, and hence&nbsp;the standard deviation of returns is the square root of the result = .117 or 11.7%</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">Notice how the standard deviation is <strong>not </strong>simply the average of the two assets in the portfolio, despite the two being equally weighted in the portfolio. The reason for this (and you can do the algebra for yourself) is that the correlation coefficient is less than 1. A correlation of 1 would imply that the two assets are <em>perfectly </em>positively correlated. Correlation coefficients less than 1 however provide diversification benefits to a portfolio.</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">To illustrate this, imagine if you combined two assets with zero correlation in a portfolio. You would use 0 instead of .75 in the formula provided above, which would entirely eliminate the last clause of the calculation. The standard deviation of returns would be significantly lower as a result.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe net-net of all this math mumbo-jumbo is that in order to reduce the standard deviation of returns in a portfolio, you should select securities and assets that are not perfectly positively correlated. In fact, an ideal&nbsp;scenario is one in which you can find assets that offer high returns but have very low correlations with each other. Additionally, the more assets in a portfolio, the greater the diversification benefits; often even as few as 15 or 18 securities can achieve full diversification of a portfolio. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:gray">Whoops.
