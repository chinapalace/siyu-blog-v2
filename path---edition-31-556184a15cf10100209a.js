The World</strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">It wouldn&#39;t be a proper brief from us without a quick note on Elon and Tesla. Last week we alluded to the importance of Tesla&#39;s release of its Model S production numbers as a bellwether for the company&#39;s short term health. Musk&#39;s goal was to produce, or at lease be capable of&nbsp;producing <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=aa0d2ffa76&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">5,000 Model 3 units per week</span></a> by quarter end. The result?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>*Queue drum roll*</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTesla did indeed manage to hit its self-imposed goal last week. We touched on the <em>creative</em>&nbsp;(critics might say <em>dubious</em>) production techniques that Tesla has <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=f01c07aa70&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">recently employed</span></a>, and Musk himself alluded to the fact that said methods may not be sustainable. &quot;Whatever. It worked,&quot; he <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=edc46d62fc&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">chirped</span></a> on Sunday.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sustainability of this production number remains unclear, and Tesla&#39;s profitability projections and cash position are still pressing issues. Nevertheless, Team Elon wins this round.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusk himself had this to say: &quot;I think we just became a real car company...&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes that mean they&#39;ll have the valuation of a real car company soon? Investors may be thinking just that, as Tesla stock actually started the 3rd quarter off by <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=d7659ab608&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">dipping </span></a>a few percent on Monday. The saga continues. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/33da3bda-1354-41bc-ab9b-4a936dba3b3b.png" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:2800px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">A lot has been made of the burgeoning &quot;trade war&quot; recently. This term, a favorite of the major news outlets, now encompasses a whole slew of posturing, not just between the US and China with respect to tariffs, but between the US and traditional trade &quot;allies&quot; <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=131a5fc79b&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">the likes of Canada</span></a> and the EU.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&#39;re not going to waste your time listing out all the US products threatened by tariffs at this current point in time (</span><span style="color:gray"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=b445127eea&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">whiskey drinkers beware, however</span></a></span><span style="color:black">).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRather, we want to highlight that whether the aggregate value of potential tariffed products is $50B, $100B, or $500B, let&#39;s keep in mind that the size of the US economy as measured by GDP is ~ <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=15d79e6107&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">$20<em> trillion </em>dollars</span></a>. We have to ask ourselves, if tariffs on $200 billion worth of products (.1%, or 10 basis points) is tipping the scale in equity markets, how strong are these markets to begin with? Nor is the trend of US protectionism all that new anyways, as evidenced by the above graphic (<a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=f49c57c661&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">source</span></a>).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, as usual we have opinions about all this. Throughout 2017, US equity markets felt like they were positively <em>yearning</em> for any reason to rocket upwards. For the past few months, it feels like they&#39;ve taken advantage of any reason to sell off. A market that&#39;s looking to sell off is very different than one that felt unstoppable not so long ago.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo this end, the below chart illustrates the &quot;wedge&quot; that the S&amp;P 500 finds itself&nbsp;narrowing into (we&#39;ve alluded to this as a &quot;box&quot; previously). US stocks are&nbsp;close to being flat&nbsp;for the year-to-date; every move upwards is eventually stymied and traced back down. We could have made almost as much money investing in treasuries as in stocks these past 6 months. The year-to-date return on the S&amp;P&nbsp;as of Friday was&nbsp;<a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=397c2cc6ff&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">1.67%</span></a>, while the yield on a 6 month treasury at the beginning of January was <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=685ed5777d&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">1.61%</span></a>*. </span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">*Bond nerds among us will note that yields are annualized, so yes, you wouldn&#39;t have done quite as well, but you get the point</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=db865921b4&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">Source </span></a>for below chart</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/e19c1a73-57cf-4c21-88d6-419a7cd091ab.jpg" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:1000px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">None of this is to say that tariffs are good, or that they don&#39;t matter. This all brings us to another topic regarding political intervention. We know you don&#39;t come here to read <em>more </em>political news. However, as it pertains to monetary policy,&nbsp;we&#39;ll take some liberties. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast week, Larry Kudlow, Trump&#39;s main economic advisor, <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=7cc5551d7d&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">had cautionary words for the Federal Reserve</span></a>, advising them not to raise interest rates too quickly lest they hurt economic growth in doing so. To be sure, it is <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=8ddb65f3b2&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><em><span style="color:#00add8">very </span></em><span style="color:#00add8">rare that US politicians </span></a>try to influence the Fed, at least overtly so.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe objectives&nbsp;of politicians and central bankers are entirely at odds. Given the importance of election cycles, the politically minded&nbsp;are invariably focused on the short-term successes needed to fuel election victories. The primary mandates of the Fed meanwhile are purely focused on preserving long-run economic health. If that means raising interest rates to slow down the economy, as the Fed thinks is appropriate right now, then there&#39;s potential for conflict.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhether we always agree with monetary policy, we recognize that the <em>independence</em> of any central bank is paramount, especially considering the fact that those at the helm are often political appointees. A Fed governed even in any way, shape or form by attempts to spur short rather than long-term economic health is a truly scary thought. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px"><span style="color:#000000">That&#39;s it for us today.
