Our apologies for slacking those last two weeks, but we&#39;re smarter, more worldly, and (slightly) more rested now. We have a lot of ground to cover after just two weeks absence, so we&#39;re going to be on the war path so to speak.

Those at the helm of the Fed certainly know a lot more than we do. But, as always, there is somebody who has gripes with their current policy, namely&nbsp;President Trump.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a </span><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=b6c8d20721&amp;e=07ec0df837" style="color:#2baadf;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000">recent interview</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> with CNCB anchor Joe Kernen, Trump claimed that he was &quot;not thrilled&quot; with the Fed&#39;s trajectory of increased rates. Now, Trump&#39;s opinion here really doesn&#39;t matter; rather it&#39;s the fact that he&#39;s openly criticizing the Fed that does.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fed is supposed to operate independent of the White House and its agenda, and this is typically how things go. In fact, no other president has openly critiqued the Fed since Nixon </span><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=1d228a4b7f&amp;e=07ec0df837" style="color:#2baadf;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000">attempted to keep monetary policy loose</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> during the early 1970s to improve his chances of re-election. (Of course, we all know Nixon had his fingers in lots of other places he shouldn&#39;t have).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrump&#39;s main gripe pertains to the parallel battle he is waging against China in the trade arena. As the Fed increases rates, holding all other factors constant, the relative strength of the US dollar will increase, as higher domestic interest rates attract foreign investment, which requires foreigners to hold US dollars. This is actually typically bearish for the trade balance; as the dollar strengthens, foreigners purchasing power for US exports decreases. That&#39;s the general reasoning behind Trump&#39;s view that a weakening dollar would be beneficial at this current juncture... and why we&#39;ll need to discuss Chinese yuan devaluation next week.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn any case, the independence of the Fed shouldn&#39;t be impeded, as we&#39;ve underscored previously.

This latest rally - the&nbsp;third time the tech index has carved out new highs since equity markets first cracked in February - was as usual led by our favorite culprits, designated &quot;FAANG&quot; for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll time highs are great for your portfolio, most likely. However - and none of our following opinion will be news to weekly readers - we reiterate&nbsp;our skepticism regarding the sustainability&nbsp;of rallies that are led by these five companies, plus a few others, and not accompanied by a diverse batch of stocks. To be sure, each new rally in the NASDAQ has seen less and less <em>breadth; </em>that is to say<em>, </em>recent upward moves have been predicated on gains in fewer and fewer stocks. (To be fair, we haven&#39;t had time to see if the same is true of today&#39;s big move upwards).

We&#39;re talking commodities that are used as inputs in the hallmarks of a roaring economy, i.e. in construction and manufacturing.
