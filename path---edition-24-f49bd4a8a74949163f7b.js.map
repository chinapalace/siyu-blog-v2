The reasoning here is simple; when oil and gas prices go up, so to do the costs of all kinds of other goods that are rolled into the CPI. If you buy a loaf of bread at the store, it was indubitably delivered there buy a semi-truck, which probably chugged along burning through lots of gasoline out on I-5. The cost of your bread will differ if gas costs $3.50 a gallon instead of $2.50.&nbsp;</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">This analysis, however, is a bit simplified. The price of oil and inflation were strongly correlated during the 1970s (aka the OPEC oil embargo which caused hours-long lines at the local Texaco station). Nowadays, per the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s </span><span style=\\\"color:gray\\\"><a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=270c5ee671&amp;e=9a010449de\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">research</span></a></span><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">, the correlation between inflation and oil isn&rsquo;t as strong as it once was.
