In the spirit of the short week, and the continuation of celebration this weekend, today&rsquo;s brief will be shorter than usual. We hope you have enjoyed our content so far; we will be working harder than ever in the coming year to keep you up to speed on the goings-on in financial markets. We&rsquo;re also excited to announce that we have made significant progress building our website, which will be up and running soon so that you can review old newsletters and explore new content. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><u><span style="color:black">A Word on Price and Market Cap<span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">Any time you travel over the holidays, be it to spend time with friends or relatives, inevitably you end up getting wrapped into some regrettable financial discussions. Be it at the bar where the now burned-out MVP high school quarterback is talking about the hot biotech stock that only costs a few bucks per share and is &ldquo;definitely going to get FDA approval&rdquo;, or your drunkard of an uncle who says that everyone needs to pile their Christmas bonuses into Ripple (XRP) {a cryptocurrency}, because its &ldquo;only at $1, and all the other ones are in the thousands.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">While such talks are often tiresome and altogether annoying, it&#39;s a good time to appreciate the important distinction that has to be made between <em>price</em> and <em>market</em> <em>capitalization</em> when evaluating a potential investment. To put it shortly, price alone doesn&rsquo;t tell you anything about any individual asset. Just because something costs $1 per share (or per coin), doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s cheap, and just because something costs $1000 per share (or per coin) doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s expensive. It&rsquo;s more helpful to start by thinking about market capitalization, otherwise known as market cap.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">What is &ldquo;market cap?&rdquo; Simply put, the market capitalization of a company (or a coin) is calculated by taking the total number of shares outstanding and multiplying that number by the price of each individual share. This is one way to achieve a rudimentary valuation of a business when it comes to analyzing equity. For instance, shares of Amazon ($AMZN) traded for $1,168 last Friday. Meanwhile, per </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/key-statistics?p=AMZN"><span style="color:#1155cc">yahoo finance,</span></a><span style="color:black"> there are about 482 million shares of Amazon common stock outstanding (this isn&rsquo;t a complete picture of the pie; executives in Amazon for instance probably have equity in the form of Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, as well as stock options and warrants which can be converted for shares). In any case, these two statistics allow us to calculate the approximate market cap for Amazon as follows:&nbsp;<span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">482 million shares outstanding - multiplied by a per share price of $1,168 - yields $563 in market cap.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">This makes Amazon one of the most valuable companies in the world (only Apple, Google, and Microsoft have a greater market cap). But what&rsquo;s important to note here is that you can&rsquo;t judge the expensiveness or cheapness of Amazon just by virtue of its price. For example, if Amazon wanted to, they could do a 1000-for-1 stock split, whereby each shareholder would get 1000 new shares for every one share they originally owned. Assuming no major news or earnings release from Amazon, each new share would suddenly only cost one dollar and seventeen cents, as it would represent 1/1000th of the equity that the old shares did. Imagine alternatively that you see a stock that costs $100,000. This would seem very expensive, but what if only 10 such shares accounted for 100% equity in the company? Suddenly, if it&rsquo;s a solid, cash generating business we&rsquo;re discussing - buying a 10% stake for $100,000 might sound so bad.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">The key takeaway here is that you can&rsquo;t decide if something is cheap or expensive, if something is a good buy or a must sell, simply by looking at price. Even once you&rsquo;ve looked at market cap, you have more work to do in deciding whether or not it reflects a fair value or not. And that in and of itself is a topic for future, 2018 discussion! </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><u><span style="color:black">Our 2018 Checklist<span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">4 pieces of encouragement and caution as we head into a new year. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t</em></strong> let your inexperience or lack of knowledge in a certain stock, industry, or general subject discourage you from investing. Instead, take the leap with a very small portion of your portfolio (.5-1%) and subsequently use your position as an <em>incentive </em>to do the required reading and research. In other words - put your money where your curiosity is, and you&rsquo;ll be more likely to become an expert in the long run.</li>\r\n\t<li><em><strong><strong><em>Stop</em></strong><strong> </strong>paying any attention to what your friends say, what your co-workers say, or to what your grandmother&rsquo;s money manager says. As an add-on from the point above, <strong><em>do</em> </strong>your own research and your own learning. Knowing how to perform basic fundamental analysis of an equity (for instance) is far more valuable in the long run than a 10% return is in the short term. Even if it seems like everyone around you is making a quick buck in crypto or in more traditional assets, chances are there is a lot of exaggeration, and that people&rsquo;s short term luck will regress to the mean in the long term. </strong></em></li>\r\n\t<li><em><strong><strong><em>Do</em></strong> set financial goals for yourself in 2018. If you&rsquo;ve never made a budget before, start. Even if just for a month. In that month, keep track of everything you spend. See how your total expenditures stack up against your total earnings. Then consider what you&rsquo;re doing with any money you saved, or alternatively if you ended up in the red, consider how you&rsquo;re managing your debt, and how you&rsquo;re going to chip away at it. If you&rsquo;ve made a budget already, think about how you&rsquo;re going to put your cash to work. How much market exposure do you want? How much cash do you want to hold for future opportunities? Set investing goals. Don&rsquo;t worry about a % return target necessarily. Worry about being able to honestly say that <em>every single one</em> of your investments was well researched. Make an explicit investment thesis, and be honest with yourself if it ends up being wrong. Then carry the lesson forward and start again. </strong></em></li>\r\n\t<li><em><strong><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t </em></strong>listen to the drumbeat of the masses. Be skeptical. Be contrarian. Here&rsquo;s an example; the conventional wisdom is that stocks go up in the long-run. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily true. You can certainly suggest that stock <em>indices </em>like the S&amp;P 500 go up over time. This is true of the past century; at the height of the Great Depression the S&amp;P 500 flatlined around 80, and is now flirting with the 2,700 marker. That&rsquo;s a fantastic return. But the S&amp;P 500 is comprised of many of the world&rsquo;s top performing companies. And there is significant <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias"><span style="color:#1155cc">survivorship bias</span></a></em></strong> involved; the 500 companies that make up the index are constantly being evaluated, and if their performance slips, they might be replaced. And there&rsquo;s nothing to say the next hundred years will be the same. </strong></em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">Here&rsquo;s an opinion; if you took a set of all publicly traded companies from the last hundred years (not just those in major indices), the modal stock, the typical company, probably went bankrupt. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">This is merely a hypothesis, there isn&rsquo;t much data immediately available data on this query. Remember there are thousands of publicly traded companies on the NYSE, and even more that aren&rsquo;t traded in any exchanges, but rather are traded </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp"><span style="color:#1155cc">&ldquo;over-the-counter.&rdquo; </span></a><span style="color:black">But it makes intuitive sense. The average company doesn&rsquo;t succeed. It&rsquo;s a first-to-the-pole, capitalistic business world - and only a few companies survive and thrive on a national and international level. Always question conventional &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">Have a safe and restful week, and a raucous weekend to ring in the New Year. We will see you in 2018. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">Nick van Osdol</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">Mark Grace</span></p>',updated:"2018-02-10T20:18:10.271677Z",fields:{slug:"Edition-4",date:"(12/27/2017)"}}},pathContext:{slug:"Edition-4"}}}});
