Take a well-deserved break from answering work emails; we&rsquo;re back as usual with a slew of content for you. In general, we may start keeping these briefs a little shorter, as we recognize the 5 or 6-page onslaught can be a bit much at times. In said spirit of brevity, let&rsquo;s dive right in.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:navy"><strong>Man in the Box</strong></span><br />\r\n<span style="color:black">A couple weeks ago we referenced just how choppy action has been in the S&amp;P 500, with no substantive, prevailing direction &ndash; neither up nor down &ndash; prevailing since January. The below chart illustrates the continuation of this trend.

What&rsquo;s to blame? Well, a fair amount of factors, but some key culprits over the past few months have included the simple age of this bull market, on-going Trump trade war bonanzas, inflationary pressures, and the subsequent rise in Treasury yields.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s talk about that latter factor a bit, or a lot, today.</span><span style="color:gray"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><span style="color:#000080">Yield, Yield, Yield</span></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">While we spent time dissecting the flattening of the US treasury yield curve last week, we will devote time to an analysis of the 10-year treasury in isolation today. We know what you might be thinking. Mark &amp; Nick, where and how do you find the boundless energy to care about US treasuries so much? That would be a fair question for us to begin with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 10-year US treasury happens to be one of the most important benchmark bonds in the market. As we have referenced previously, bond yields are comprised of inflation premium and default risk premium. Increases in bond yields, especially treasuries &ndash; which carry very, very little default risk premium &ndash; are decent proxies for tracking rises in expected inflation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the buck of this bond doesn&rsquo;t stop at&nbsp;its utility as an inflation gauge. The yield of the 10-year US Treasury is perhaps most instrumental because of its role as a&nbsp;frequent stand-in for the &ldquo;risk-free rate.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t let us mislead you &ndash; many different treasury maturities can be used as a proxy for the risk-free rate. The 10-year is most useful&nbsp;in cases where long-term duration of cash flows, such as for a major project, are being evaluated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince treasuries are about the closest thing investors&nbsp;can find to riskless return, the yield of the 10-year is often used in mathematical equations such as the<a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=25a8aeeb33&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8"> Capital Asset Pricing Model </span></a>(&ldquo;the CAPM&rdquo;) that incorporate a longer dated risk-free rate as a variable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe CAPM is a fundamental formula by which a firm can approximate its cost of equity, or by which investors can determine the rate of return they would require to buy a firm&rsquo;s equity shares. The formula is as follows (you&rsquo;ll see the importance of the risk free rate):</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><span style="color:black">Asset return&nbsp;(or required rate of return) = Risk free rate + &beta;*(Market return &ndash; risk free rate)</span></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">Here, &beta; represents <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=6ea4abbbc9&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">Beta</span></a>, which is a separately calculated variable that measures an&nbsp;asset&rsquo;s <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=1bd67f7a9c&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">systemic</span></a> (market) risk. Specifically, Beta is defined as the covariance between the asset and the market expressed in terms of the market&rsquo;s variance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLest we digress on the math too much, you can see how increases in the risk free rate can also increase a firm&rsquo;s cost of capital, though depending on the magnitude of &beta;, and in cases where the market return doesn&#39;t increase along with the risk free rate,&nbsp;this isn&rsquo;t always true. As a firm&rsquo;s cost of capital rises, it will be less likely to invest in new projects or ventures, as these projects become more expensive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:black">Not to inundate you with more theory, but firms determine the desirability of projects based on the <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=2299e99b43&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">Net Present Value </span></a>(&ldquo;NPV&rdquo;) they are expected to deliver. NPV calculations leverage a discount rate to translate future cash flow streams into present values; the discount rate used is most commonly the firm&rsquo;s cost of capital. As cost of capital increases, NPV calculations are positive less frequently, and in aggregate, investing in new storefronts or mining equipment or whatever it may be that a company may need to increase future profitability becomes more difficult from a cost benefit perspective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile a rising 10-year yield can mean higher cost of capital for companies, you might imagine that it runs in contrast to the flatter yield curve we discussed last week. Given that focal attention of yield curve steepness is often oriented on the spread between the 2, 5, 7 and 10-year yield, increases in the 10-year should at the minimum keep the yield curve from inverting, although so far yields in nearer dated maturity treasuries <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=b08fc97b02&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">have moved up in lock-step </span></a>with the 10-year, keeping the curve flat overall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking of the 2, 5, and 7 year treasuries, it&rsquo;s a huge week in treasury auction land, as the US Treasury is slated to sell ~ <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=53a6ec36e2&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">$96 billion in treasuries </span></a>this week, specifically in these aforementioned maturities. $32 billion of 2-year notes were already sold yesterday (4/24). Remember that <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=ecfe9dcadb&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">treasury auctions</span></a> are how the yields we constantly discuss are determined. This the largest total treasury sale for these maturities in 4 years, and if demand isn&rsquo;t ready to match the size of the auction, yields for these treasuries could jump up, narrowing the spread with the 10-year even further.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow that we&rsquo;re out of breath, let&rsquo;s pause for a visual appreciation of 10-year yield&rsquo;s movement over the last year:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/a3405089-b8ac-4c5a-b5eb-488d1966313f.png" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:1120px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">It certainly looks like the 10-year yield may be preparing for another moon mission (higher) in its own right. As the current yield hit<u> </u><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=369e9b1ba7&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">the 3% threshold yesterday</span></a>, we&rsquo;ll be interested to see how the next few days play out as far as investor sentiment surrounding this psychological (nice whole numbers, yay) level is concerned. Demand may perk up, stabilizing yields again for the time being, but if yesterday&rsquo;s <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=950112b389&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">equity selloff </span></a>is any indication, further increases in yields couldd hurt broadly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=34ca2f2247&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">&ldquo;A move above 3% wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></a> said John Briggs, head of American strategy at&nbsp;NatWest markets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks for the corroborative insight, John. We&rsquo;re in no way offering any direct investment advice here, but as far as our own appetites are concerned, 10-year yields in the 3-3.5% could start looking pretty attractive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what does this mean for equity owners? Well, there&rsquo;s an argument for swapping your equities for risk- free treasuries when they offer attractive yields. In the words of JonesTrading&rsquo;s Michael O&rsquo;Rourke: &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll look like a bear market in bonds, which should make investors concerned since risk-free assets will be yielding more...&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we ourselves may choose to buy some treasuries here soon, that&rsquo;s money we&rsquo;re not pumping into stocks. If many market participants follow suit, equity demand will fall more than we already observed yesterday.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother argument for owning treasuries stems from <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=929179542f&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">the two-fund separation theorem</span></a>, which posits that any optimal portfolio allocates some percentage of its funds to the risk-free asset. We won&rsquo;t do a deep dive on the theory today (we can see you drooling though) but the crux of it lies in the diversification benefits of risk-free assets. Diversification of portfolio assets helps curb total portfolio risk (measured as the standard deviation of returns), and the less correlated assets are within a portfolio, the more diversification they offer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a final note, if you do go snatch up some treasuries, keep in mind they are zero-coupon bonds; they don&rsquo;t make periodic payments, but are rather purchased at a discount from face value and are then repaid at face value at maturity. Thus, don&rsquo;t plan on receiving cash flows over the life of the treasury as you might with other bonds.</span><span style="color:gray"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><span style="color:navy">Art as an Alternative Asset?</span></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">Though retail investors generally confine themselves to equities and bonds, there are entire realms of<br />\r\nother investments we rarely touch on in our briefs. We do talk about derivatives &ndash; especially given Nick&rsquo;s proclivity for needlessly complex multi-leg options trading strategies (the <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=cd55efc153&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">iron condor </span></a>is a favorite) &ndash; but real estate, commodities, other types of pooled investment funds, venture capital, and private equity are all viable investment spaces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat about fine art and wine? You bet your bottom (or top) dollar they can serve as investment vehicles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou&rsquo;re probably not quite liquid enough to be shelling out a few million for an Agnes Martin anytime soon (but who are we to judge?), but one tidbit we did want to touch on briefly is the rise of services hoping to democratize ownership of fine art. <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=bf4766986c&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">Masterworks</span></a> for instance came to our attention; it&rsquo;s a platform offering individual shares in famous artworks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile eye-popping price tags, like the <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=e8f02489d5&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">$450 million </span></a>paid for da Vinci&rsquo;s &ldquo;Salvator Mundi&rdquo; certainly remain a remote fantasy for most of us, these new share investing endeavors will indubitably make art a more accessible asset class. We&rsquo;d caution that valuation of art remains a highly esoteric field. We certainly can&rsquo;t help you out in that department, but if this interest you, take a look.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, rest assured &mdash; there are those that can help you value that Monet in your great aunt&rsquo;s attic, when you find it. Most major banks have a private banking (or use some different but similar nomenclature) department that lend to Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWIs). Unlike a commercial bank, private banking departments underwrite loans to UHNWIs, not companies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile these UHNWIs have &mdash; for lack of better terminology &mdash; ultra high&nbsp;net worth, they may not always be liquid (read: have cash ready to deploy), and thus may not be able to meet their immediate spending needs (yacht week anyone?). However, private banks and other lenders are increasingly accepting art as collateral on for loans. <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=94fc904cf4&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">This </span></a>Wall Street Journal (paywall) article documents the rise in art-based lending back in 2015, and the practice has increased since. (Side note: JP Morgan&rsquo;s private bank has a division that focuses on private airplane financing).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe may know our way around an equity or bond valuation, but we know next to nothing about the strategies lenders employ to value art. However, we do realize the fairly obvious risks of art-based lending: verifying the authenticity of a piece and verifying that the title (or that the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; actually owns it).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt could certainly offer diversification benefits to a portfolio, though we imagine the value of this asset class broadly retains some correlation to equities insofar as prices likely decline during periods of economic downturn, as demand for luxury goods is generally quite elastic.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:black">You probably didn&rsquo;t expect to read about something as niche as art investing and lending, but we&rsquo;re here to keep you on your toes.
