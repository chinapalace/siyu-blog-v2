Thank you all for coming back for another edition of our weekly brief (number 16!); we are excited to share more thoughts this week.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">There&rsquo;s a metric ton of analysis we want to deliver on both the equity and bond markets this week, so today&rsquo;s brief will focus on said news at the expense of our usual financial education portion. If you have extra time on your hands, go ahead and take another pass at our discussion of the discounted cash flow model from </span><a href="https://siyucapital.com/newsletters/16/"><span style="color:blue">last week.</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Let&rsquo;s get a move on, the market waits for no one. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:#000000">Equity Index Breakdown</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Rallies that don&rsquo;t have broad-based support from a large portion of the equities in an index are far more likely to struggle. This is what we have observed in the NASDAQ of recent. The index hit all-time highs for the first time since the dot-com bubble last week:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000"><img alt="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYRkphgXUAACOuu.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYRkphgXUAACOuu.jpg:large" style="height:311px; width:624px" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">(chart as of 3/13/18)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">However, as we observed on Monday, the index proceeded to sell off heavily after closing last week below the newfound highs, ultimately finishing down only slightly less than 2%. This decline was led by Facebook, which dropped approximately 7%, as the company faces extended pressure from </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cambridge-analytica/british-prime-minister-very-concerned-by-facebook-data-abuse-reports-idUSKBN1GV1V6"><span style="color:blue">probes into its data usage practices.</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">How does an index go from breaching new highs to dipping 2% over the course of a few days? Part of the reason for both the initial gains and subsequent volatility in the tech sector hinges on the fact that 5 companies alone account for more than 25% of the NASDAQ. To be specific, the NASDAQ is a </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp"><span style="color:blue">market-cap weighted index</span></a><span style="color:#000000">, which means we evaluate the weight of any individual equity based on the proportion of its market cap to the total market cap of all equities in the index. What&rsquo;s market cap again? See below:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><u><span style="color:#000000">Market Capitalization</span></u><span style="color:#000000"> = price per share * total # of outstanding shares. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Wondering what five companies account for so much of the NASDAQ? We&rsquo;re sure you can guess a few. We often refer to them as the &ldquo;FAANG&rdquo; stocks. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">&ldquo;FAANG&rdquo; = Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">As shown below, these companies represent more than a quarter of the NASDAQ at current. Anytime the equity of these companies sells off heavily, the entire NASDAQ will likely be down overall. The chart here tracks the proportion of NASDAQ that FAANG stocks have commanded over the last few years: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000"><img alt="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYqOJcdW0AAy3Ox.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYqOJcdW0AAy3Ox.jpg:large" style="height:420px; width:559px" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">(</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jessefelder/status/975748964984262658"><span style="color:blue">chart credit</span></a><span style="color:#000000">)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The key takeaway here is that the all-time highs we saw last week in the NASDAQ didn&rsquo;t actually represent a broad, market wide rally. As big names like Facebook and Netflix sold off on Monday, they pulled the rug out from underneath the entire index they&rsquo;d been propping up. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">What are some other potential stress factors for markets? For one, we&rsquo;re looking forward to a key Federal Reserve policy decision today. Read on. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:#000000">To Hike or not to Hike? </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fomc.asp"><span style="color:blue">Federal Open Market Committee</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> (FOMC) began meetings yesterday, and today we will receive announcements regarding their decisions on monetary policy (</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/21/bonds-and-fixed-income-data-fed-meeting-on-the-agenda-for-investors.html"><span style="color:#0563c1">we await &ldquo;Big Jerome&rdquo; at 2pm eastern</span></a><span style="color:#000000">). Specifically, we will be interested in whether or not the FOMC will &ldquo;hike&rdquo; (hike = increase) the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points (.25%). Market participants are pricing in a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/975721828827254785"><span style="color:blue">~ 95%</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> of a rate hike, which is part of a widely anticipated 3 rate increase program for 2018. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">We&rsquo;ve covered related topics at length in previous briefs (editions </span><a href="https://siyucapital.com/newsletters/10/"><span style="color:blue">8</span></a><span style="color:#000000">,</span><a href="https://siyucapital.com/newsletters/9/"><span style="color:blue">9</span></a><span style="color:#000000">, and </span><a href="https://siyucapital.com/newsletters/13/"><span style="color:blue">12</span></a><span style="color:#000000">), but we&rsquo;ll reiterate a few points regarding the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp"><span style="color:blue">Federal Funds Rate</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> and a rising interest rate environment now. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Mark and Nick, what happens when the Federal funds rate goes up? What happens when interest rates go up in general? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">As we have discussed previously, the Federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks lend each other money overnight, often to help each other meet </span><a href="about:blank"><span style="color:blue">reserve requirements</span></a><span style="color:#000000">. While this rate is specific to banks, as the Federal Reserve raises this rate, the consequences &lsquo;trickle down&rsquo; to other interest rates throughout the economy. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Consider the following: when banks can&rsquo;t borrow from each other to meet reserve requirements as cheaply (given higher interest rates), they begin to raise their own rates, namely those they charge their customers. As a result, changes (especially increases) in the Federal Funds rate get passed on throughout the economy pretty readily. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">In short, when the Fed funds rate goes up, debt payments for companies and individual consumers alike will go up. In an economy that is already laden with debt, this could begin to cause problems. See the below chart for a depiction of Corporate America&rsquo;s rising debt as a percentage of GDP ratio.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000"><img alt="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYGSR8sWsAAO1CR.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYGSR8sWsAAO1CR.jpg" style="height:402px; width:561px" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><a href="https://twitter.com/jessefelder/status/973219892567728130/photo/1"><span style="color:blue">(chart credit)</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=jesse+felder&amp;form=EDGTCT&amp;qs=PF&amp;cvid=2af9dfb941bd47948b7ccf6f0c1a7652&amp;cc=US&amp;setlang=en-US"><span style="color:blue">Jesse Felder</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> shared the following in regard to this issue: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:48px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">&ldquo;Many companies really lived on due to this (observed) low interest rate environment. Zombie companies, those that earn less than they pay in interest, are on the rise again. That&rsquo;s why you have to watch the corporate market. Right now, it&rsquo;s not a problem. But let&rsquo;s say we go to 4% on ten year Treasuries&hellip;A 4% on the ten year bond seems completely plausible. So how do you think these (risky) assets respond? And what does it mean for other markets? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">What Felder focuses on in the above is the relationship between Treasury yields and corporate bond yields. Given that US Treasuries are largely seen and referenced as &ldquo;risk-free&rdquo;, corporate bond yields, which carry larger default risk among other risk factors, must always be higher than Treasuries to compensate for this additional risk. With Treasury yields already moon-bound this year (see below), the heat is on for corporations that depend on continued debt financing. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000"><img alt="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYp11P2U8AIXdqA.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYp11P2U8AIXdqA.jpg:large" style="height:600px; width:450px" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><a href="https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/975721828827254785"><span style="color:blue">(credit)</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">If investors have systematically misallocated capital by buying up risky corporate bonds at less-than-commensurate yields, the pain could be widespread. One argument that speaks in favor of this being the current scenario is that passive investing strategies allocate funds into corporate debt without performing necessary levels of credit analysis. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">If too many market participants adhere to the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just buy a broad swath of corporate debt without analyzing any of it&rdquo; philosophy, there could be a large scale divergence between what these companies&rsquo; debt is actually worth and what was paid for it. This is a long-term trend that bears (pun fully intended) watching. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">We went down the rabbit-hole there a bit as usual, but the key insight here is that we should watch both of the below this week and in the immediate short-term:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">Treasury auctions, to see how yields respond to the rate hike (or the unlikely absence thereof)</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">Equity markets response to any potential change in Treasury yields</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:48px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Again, this rate hike should be largely &ldquo;priced-in.&rdquo; We say priced-in when information has been readily available and thus should already be baked into current equity and bond valuations. Investors market wide are relatively sure that the Fed will raise the Fed funds rate 25 basis points today, so there&rsquo;s no reason that a rate hike absent any other information should disturb the current order of things.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:#000000">The National Deficit Widens, as Expected&hellip;</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">By now, readers of this newsletter are well aware of the keen eye we keep on the national debt and budget deficit. Those in Washington don&rsquo;t seem to share our interest. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Before covering news about the national debt, here&rsquo;s a quick review of its importance:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:48px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The US must repay its debts to its debt holders (individuals, funds, foreign sovereign nations, etc.), just like you must repay your debt to credit card companies. As long as we continue to make our interest payments, our relationship with our debt holders is fine, and we get to issue new debt to finance spending as well as to actually make payments on debt that is currently due. If, however, we default on these interest payments, then our credit situation could unwind quickly; new lenders would disappear, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to issue new debt to finance existing obligations. Default would deepen quickly. Obviously, this is a massively oversimplified picture; other credit stress factors we&rsquo;ve outlined in the past include scenarios in which a new global economic power emerges and becomes a more preferred issuer of debt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The US sported a </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-12/u-s-posts-biggest-budget-deficit-since-2012-as-tax-income-falls"><span style="color:#1155cc">$215B</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> budget deficit in February (a 12% year over year increase) &mdash; the largest deficit in six years! </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">This deficit increase is helping to further the national debt to new heights (or lows, depending upon your perspective) &mdash; total US debt has hit $21T in the last week according to the </span><a href="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current"><span style="color:#1155cc">Treasury Department</span></a><span style="color:#000000">.&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">What&rsquo;s causing this rapid increase in debt? We&rsquo;ve discussed a few drivers previously, but the two main culprits are increased government spending and lower taxes (recall our analysis of the December Trump tax plan and its magnifying effect on the debt). To add propane to this self-immolating mess, the White House signed a debt-limit suspension bill in February that &ldquo;allow[s] unlimited borrowing until March 1, 2019,&rdquo; according to </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-national-debt-exceeds-21-trillion-for-first-time-2018-03-16"><span style="color:#1155cc">Market Watch</span></a><span style="color:#000000">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">What&rsquo;s the net-net of this? Well, as the headline of this section hints, not much; this treatment of the deficit is sort of baked-into our political and economic structure at this point. It&rsquo;s not like this is the first administration that has thrown caution to the wind with deficit increases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Despite some usual doom and gloom, markets look perky this morning. We&rsquo;ll see whether or not the Fed adopts a more hawkish tone today, which could send things red again. As always, thanks for tuning in and please reach out with any thoughts, questions, concerns, or if you just want to say hi.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Cheers,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Nick and Mark</span></p>',updated:"2018-08-09T22:02:37.656493Z",fields:{slug:"Edition-16",date:"(3/21/18)"}}},pathContext:{slug:"Edition-16"}}}});
