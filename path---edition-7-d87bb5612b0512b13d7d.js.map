For instance, when a major company issues debt in the form of bonds, investors can buy the bonds, whereby they are effectively lending the company money with specified expectations regarding the interest they will be paid on the capital they lent out, when this interest will be paid, and under what terms. These terms are known as the covenants of the bond. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">As we approach an overarching discussion of the US Bond market over the past week or so, we will rely on an understanding of the concept of yield. Yield as a financial term simply refers to the expected return of an investment. A bond&rsquo;s yield simply refers to the amount of cash that will return to the lender who owns the bond. It is usually expressed as an annualized percentage of the initial investment, which for bonds constitutes the initial amount lent out. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">For instance, if you purchase a $100 zero-coupon bond (no payments, or &ldquo;coupons&rdquo;, until maturity), with a maturity of 1 year in the open market, it might cost you $97, for instance. This bond&rsquo;s yield would be calculated as (100-97)/97 = approximately 3%. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">Many bonds, especially longer maturity ones, have &ldquo;coupons.&rdquo; This simply means that the bonds pay interest on the principal (the amount lent) at certain intervals, in addition to paying back the entire principal at maturity. For these bonds, their yield calculation becomes more complicated, as the present value of future cash flows must be determined. In any case, that&rsquo;s a topic for a future discussion that gets somewhat confusing fast.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">Now that we understand yield, the following statement should make sense: </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><strong><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">Whereas in the equity market, selling pressure on equities reduces the equities&rsquo; price, in the bond market, selling pressure of the bond <em>increases</em></span><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\"> the bond&rsquo;s yield. </span></strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">Why is this the case? From a supply and demand perspective, as demand for bond&rsquo;s decreases, their yield must increase to attract new investors; hence giving rise to the aforementioned axiom. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">That is, a bond&rsquo;s price and yield are inversely correlated. An example of this terminology in use can be found in </span><a href=\\\"https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-01-11/exceptional-record-smashing-demand-30y-paper-sends-yields-tumbling\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#0000ff\\\">this</span></a><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\"> recently article, outlining record demand for 30 year US Treasuries and the subsequent fall in their yield.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">As you might expect, different bonds provide different yields. Given two bonds of the same maturity, the &ldquo;riskier&rdquo; one &mdash; i.e., the bond with the higher chance of defaulting on its payments &mdash; will carry the higher yield. Why? Investors demand more yield for taking on more risk. This is why a corporation&rsquo;s 10-year bond carries a higher yield than a 10-year Treasury bond. (Corporations have a higher likelihood of defaulting than the US government).</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">By the same logic, bonds of similar risk profile will have different yields based on their time to maturity. The longer the bond takes to mature, the higher the yield. Generally, investors take on more risk by holding longer term bonds, so they demand a higher yield.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">Differences in yield get more complicated beyond this.
