Progress on our website is humming along - we know you can&#39;t wait. We also know that we&#39;ve been awfully zoomed out on the macro level over the last weeks, so we&#39;ll be honing&nbsp;in on AT LEAST one very specific, actionable, concept this morning. We promise.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:navy"><strong>But First, Elon</strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">If you know us, then you know that no brief is really complete without an update on the goings-on in the realm of Elon. His latest move? Considering, via Tweet of course, that he might take Tesla private:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black"><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/e4614247-3aae-4129-a94c-dcb35d74bd67.png" style="border:initial; height:72px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; margin-top:0px; outline:none; text-decoration:none; width:500px" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">Musk later emailed his thoughts to the company, see <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=68025ab6ea&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#2baadf">this blog post </span></a>by Tesla a few hours after the original tweet. Taking Tesla private certainly would shelter it from a portion of the immense scrutiny it faces (e.g., its one of the most-shorted securities on the market). Further, Musk notes that the move would prevent Tesla from prioritizing short-term performance (for quarterly earnings announcements) over its long-term goals. We agree with that part wholeheartedly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Musk said &quot;funding secured,&quot; it remains unclear who the potential buyers or syndicate of buyers are. Tesla wouldn&#39;t be the first <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=4a62055f81&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#2baadf">high-profile company</span></a> to go private, but if it becomes the subject of a <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=40e0a01897&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#2baadf">Leveraged Buyout</span></a>&nbsp;(&quot;LBO&quot;), it would certainly be one of the <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=60c11f3ca1&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#2baadf">largest firms to be taken private in this fashion</span></a>. Similarly, it would be taken private at an EBITDA multiple more than double the typical LBO average.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf Elon think short sellers&#39; &quot;<a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=ec9c23bf6b&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#2baadf">propaganda&quot;</span></a> is bad for his company, we&#39;re not sure why he thinks LBO lenders will be any more forgiving of questionable financials. They won&#39;t just tweet mean things about him, they&#39;ll seize&nbsp;company assets if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, if Mr. Musk has not actually &quot;secured funding&quot; for this deal, then he <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=885c5b0650&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#2baadf">could face legal trouble</span></a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bottom line is that Tesla has a great product that people love. Most companies would kill to be in that position. Increasingly however, Elon&#39;s antics are jeopardizing, rather than helping further, his original product vision. If a deal is actually imminent, why not do what normally companies do,&nbsp;and... you know, have a board meeting, make a collective decision, halt trading of the stock, and then release a polished report to the public? We&#39;re still waiting for answers nearly 24 hours later.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Disclosure:</strong> We have no position, long or short, in $TSLA, nor would we touch it with a ten-foot rod right now. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:navy"><strong>When Cash Isn&#39;t Trash</strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">We occasionally remember that not all of you are here to read our weekly pontifications about market mechanics, the Fed, or obtuse financial products. So yes, we&#39;ve realized we may have, again, gotten too deep in the nonsense of recent.</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">To turn the page, we&#39;re going to focus on a question that should be somewhat more relevant for the average reader. Namely, how should&nbsp;you deploy excess cash?&nbsp;We&#39;re not talking about whether or not you should invest in the stock market at this point right now; no, we actually want to focus on <em>cash</em>.</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">It&#39;s no secret that banks engage in broad-daylight thievery when they offer you virtually no interest on your checking and savings accounts.

Well, financial theory typically uses US Treasuries as a stand-in for the </span><span style="color:#202020"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=ca073df0e7&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">risk-free interest rate</span></a></span><span style="color:black">. And guess what, </span><span style="color:#202020"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=8cc65397b4&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">you can buy those</span></a></span><span style="color:black">.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven that the Federal Reserve is already a few years along it&#39;s interest rate increase regime, it&#39;s worth&nbsp;noting that&nbsp;Treasuries will get you a higher yield than a traditional savings account. The rub with Treasuries is that you&#39;re locking up your cash for the length of the bill&#39;s maturity, and can&#39;t use the cash for emergencies or such (early redemption penalties are steep).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut if your goal is simply to combat the incessant march of inflation, even the 3 month US Treasury is currently yielding an annualized rate of ~ 2%. (Chart down below). And if you&#39;re okay with locking up cash for longer, the 10-year is still yielding close to 3%. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/a4c0e745-153e-4496-a6a0-5774bf65b26d.png" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:765px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:null">We have no idea how banks get away with offering 0% interest on their deposits, especially when market interest rates are higher than </span><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=516cf4adde&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:null">they have been since 2009</span></a><span style="color:null">. Banks are in no way a safer place for your money than Treasuries. The answer probably lies in the fact that people are simply too lazy to battle for 2% yield.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf that sounds like you, just remember that the Federal Reserve is employing some of the brightest minds in the country to get&nbsp;inflation running at 2% annually. And given that 2% annual inflation represents a 22% decline in your purchasing power over a decade, yes, all this does add up. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/e20907e0-b500-4dbd-b354-8686a67e1e3a.png" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; height:auto; max-width:699px; outline:none; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:#222222">The VIX - the <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=0101a1fba5&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#2baadf">volatility measuring index</span></a> that everyone was talking about back in February when the market tanked - read 10.52 yesterday, its lowest reading since mid January. What does a 10.52 reading mean? We won&#39;t go into the math, but it tells us S&amp;P 500 options are priced for a 3.04% move in the market over the next month. Those are some tame expectations, especially when compared to the VIX levels achieved in early February, when options were pricing in&nbsp;10% +&nbsp;monthly&nbsp;moves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs markets are looking to make new all-time highs this week, all is&nbsp;quiet in the volatility gauge. Just as the office water-cooler chatter about how great being in stocks is right now picks up, it&#39;s worth keeping your eyes on this sleeping giant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Disclosure:</strong> Nick put on a small VIX hedge via call spreads slated for November expiration this morning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:navy"><strong>Passive Investing: Probably Smart, but Proceed with Caution</strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">Something we have often alluded to but not necessary pinned down in specific is our view on the risks inherent to the &quot;passive investing&quot; trend. For the majority of us who are not seasoned financial professionals, the mantra of the last decade has been that you can&#39;t beat the market and that investing in the S&amp;P&nbsp;500, or in ETFs that mimic broader swathes of stocks and bonds, is the way to go.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:black">There are plenty of good reasons that explain why &quot;passive investing&quot; (as opposed to &quot;actively&quot; picking and choosing individual stocks) has rocketed in popularity. A few of these are as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="list-style-type:disc">\r\n\t<li><span style="color:black">The market has performed extremely well since the 2008 financial crisis. The NASDAQ is up over 300% and the S&amp;P 500 is up over 200% on a total return basis since 1/1/2009</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:black">The fees charged by ETFs and &quot;passive&quot; money managers are minimal, while active investors typically charge higher fees. To boot, Fidelity is actually&nbsp;rolling out its first index funds that are <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=e0d86b0801&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#2baadf">completely free of fees</span></a>.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:black">As we mentioned earlier, passive investing requires far less work than trying to actively select stocks and bonds</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">Let&#39;s take a step back. For passive investing to work well, markets have to be <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=9cadc7edf7&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#2baadf">efficient</span></a>, aka the prices for individual stocks and bonds on average have to be <em>fair</em>-ish. If the prices for stocks and bonds accurately reflect all currently available information and forecast into the future accordingly, then there&#39;s little utility in spending money or time trying to find securities that are under-valued to buy or securities that are over-valued to sell short.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo let&#39;s go ahead and assume market prices are efficient. Now let&#39;s take this set up to its logical extreme. If 100% of investors, both on an individual and an institutional level, all suddenly stop doing fundamental analysis of securities (aka asking themselves &quot;what is this individual little thing actually worth?&quot;) then the very mechanism by which efficient prices are achieved goes out the window. Given no research and no buying and selling to set market prices, asset prices would be free to deviate wildly from &quot;fair value.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile you may justly conclude that you don&#39;t have the time and / or knowledge to build&nbsp;an optimal portfolio of assets for your own financial future, your ability to trust the market hinges on there being a contingent of people who are engaged with the question of what securities are actually worth. And more than ever, it seems that the breadth of market participants engaged in fundamental analysis is withering away:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px"><span style="color:null">&quot;JPMorgan notes that only about 10 per cent of US equity investment is now done by traditional, discretionary traders.
