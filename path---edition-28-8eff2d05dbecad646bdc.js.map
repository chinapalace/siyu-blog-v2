Businesses can index their prices to expected increases, and employers can (ideally) index wages similarly. The most problematic inflationary situation is one in which inflation deviates from expectations. This happens often, as inflation is hard to measure over periods of time; prices for goods are constantly in flux as are changes in demand for goods and the quality of said goods.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nPerhaps the key problem with unexpected changes in inflation is that&nbsp;peoples&#39; &nbsp;forecasts&nbsp;become less accurate. Think of a company that builds houses. If this firm sees input prices for their goods (lumber for construction) rising, in the absence of inflationary expectations, they will conclude demand for new homes is increasing. The firm may choose to higher more workers, or&nbsp;invest in new machinery&nbsp;to increase productivity and meet the expected increase in demand. If however the price increases in inputs were due to unexpected inflation rather than increases in demand, the firm has inefficiently allocated its capital.</span><br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#202020\\\">See below for an example, namely the manner in which the <a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=b5237d623f&amp;e=9a010449de\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#2baadf\\\">unexpected surge in gas prices </span></a>is already cutting deep into US consumer saving.&nbsp;Note, this is more of a supply and demand issue, but it still speaks to how expectations affect how you use your money.

For our purposes, we&#39;re referring to the correlation of the relationship in price movements of two or more securities. For instance, the stocks of two oil &amp; gas companies (say Chevron and Exxon Mobil) typically move together; that is, they are positively correlated given how much of both businesses is tied to the price of oil.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThere are also negatively correlated securities. A derivative, such as a put option, that increases in value when the underlying asset&#39;s value decreases will have negative correlation with the underlying asset, which should make intuitive sense. Gold and treasuries, which are often seen as &quot;<a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=f5d913953f&amp;e=9a010449de\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#2baadf\\\">flight--to-safety</span></a>&quot; assets, also can appreciate during periods of market turmoil, thus assuming negative correlation with equity (for these assets, this is&nbsp;not always true).<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nIf you want to be specific about the correlations of assets you&#39;re considering combining in a portfolio, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t calculate the correlation for yourself. Excel will be most helpful in this exercise, as it has a built in formula for such calculations.

Next week we&#39;ll cover the theory behind this simple axiom, for now it suffices to say that per the theorem, all rational investors will hold some combination of risky assets and the risk-free asset. The takeaway is that no matter what else you invest in, portfolio theory prescribes that you also invest in treasuries, aka the closest thing we have to a risk-free asset. The reason for this comes from a synthesis of the two bullet points we presented so far, but more on this next week!</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr />\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:navy\\\"><strong>What&#39;s next for the Fed?</strong></span><br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:black\\\">As previously mentioned, the Fed is planning to raise rates this Wednesday&nbsp;from&nbsp;1.75%&nbsp;to 2%. This is the second such increase this year. Our aforementioned discussion on inflation alluded to the Fed&#39;s mandate to keep inflation in line (at or below 2% annually). Per the </span><span style=\\\"color:#202020\\\"><a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=d2f1d9bee9&amp;e=9a010449de\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">Wall Street Journal</span></a></span><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">, the Fed&#39;s recent rate hikes have been quite successful with this, as evidenced by the following chart:</span><span style=\\\"color:#202020\\\"> </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:12pt; margin:0px\\\"><img id=\\\"_x0000_i1025\\\" src=\\\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/37859724-8591-4c0f-b321-f8e20d5c0c7b.png\\\" style=\\\"border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:1504px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px\\\" /></span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr />\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">This begs the question: will the Fed continue to raise rates throughout the remainder of 2018? While the expected number of remaining rate hikes in 2018 is 1 (September), there is considerable debate regarding what rate hike path the Fed will and should choose.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nA 4th rate hike&nbsp;could definitely be in the cards for late 2018.&nbsp;Granted the late stage of this bull market, Trump tax cuts, and theoretically burgeoning inflation, the 4-total-hike camp is advocating for an extra increase to ensure that the inflation doesn&#39;t overshoot the 2% target. However, the argument against a fourth hike is that the Fed may hamper growth, potentially triggering widespread unemployment and even a recession down the line, as we alluded to earlier.

For our purposes, we&#39;re referring to the correlation of the relationship in price movements of two or more securities. For instance, the stocks of two oil &amp; gas companies (say Chevron and Exxon Mobil) typically move together; that is, they are positively correlated given how much of both businesses is tied to the price of oil.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThere are also negatively correlated securities. A derivative, such as a put option, that increases in value when the underlying asset&#39;s value decreases will have negative correlation with the underlying asset, which should make intuitive sense. Gold and treasuries, which are often seen as &quot;<a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=f5d913953f&amp;e=9a010449de\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#2baadf\\\">flight--to-safety</span></a>&quot; assets, also can appreciate during periods of market turmoil, thus assuming negative correlation with equity (for these assets, this is&nbsp;not always true).<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nIf you want to be specific about the correlations of assets you&#39;re considering combining in a portfolio, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t calculate the correlation for yourself. Excel will be most helpful in this exercise, as it has a built in formula for such calculations. All you have to do is construct two data sets (two columns) with historical price information on your assets of choice.

Next week we&#39;ll cover the theory behind this simple axiom, for now it suffices to say that per the theorem, all rational investors will hold some combination of risky assets and the risk-free asset. The takeaway is that no matter what else you invest in, portfolio theory prescribes that you also invest in treasuries, aka the closest thing we have to a risk-free asset. The reason for this comes from a synthesis of the two bullet points we presented so far, but more on this next week!</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr />\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:navy\\\"><strong>What&#39;s next for the Fed?</strong></span><br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:black\\\">As previously mentioned, the Fed is planning to raise rates this Wednesday&nbsp;from&nbsp;1.75%&nbsp;to 2%. This is the second such increase this year. Our aforementioned discussion on inflation alluded to the Fed&#39;s mandate to keep inflation in line (at or below 2% annually). Per the </span><span style=\\\"color:#202020\\\"><a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=d2f1d9bee9&amp;e=9a010449de\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">Wall Street Journal</span></a></span><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">, the Fed&#39;s recent rate hikes have been quite successful with this, as evidenced by the following chart:</span><span style=\\\"color:#202020\\\"> </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:12pt; margin:0px\\\"><img id=\\\"_x0000_i1025\\\" src=\\\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/37859724-8591-4c0f-b321-f8e20d5c0c7b.png\\\" style=\\\"border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:1504px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px\\\" /></span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr />\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">This begs the question: will the Fed continue to raise rates throughout the remainder of 2018? While the expected number of remaining rate hikes in 2018 is 1 (September), there is considerable debate regarding what rate hike path the Fed will and should choose.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nA 4th rate hike&nbsp;could definitely be in the cards for late 2018.&nbsp;Granted the late stage of this bull market, Trump tax cuts, and theoretically burgeoning inflation, the 4-total-hike camp is advocating for an extra increase to ensure that the inflation doesn&#39;t overshoot the 2% target. However, the argument against a fourth hike is that the Fed may hamper growth, potentially triggering widespread unemployment and even a recession down the line, as we alluded to earlier.
