Over the weekend, news that the <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=1c83cef1a1&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">Italian president had vetoed the formation of a coalition government </span></a>between La Lega and the&nbsp;Five Star&nbsp;Movement sent a shudder through markets. The follow-through on Monday&nbsp;included a 1-2% decline in the Dow and S&amp;P 500 (these have mostly reversed today).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1990, Italy&#39;s was the 5th largest economy in the world. Today, its economy&nbsp;is <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=51e99911a2&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">36% smaller than the UKs</span></a>. To understand how the political situation in Italy is still causing a ripple effect in global markets, its worth starting with the fact that Italy is in the midst of a populist uprising of its own.&nbsp;In March 4th voting, the two parties that&nbsp;had the best results were La Lega (18%, dubbed &quot;far-right&quot; typically) and the&nbsp;Five Star&nbsp;Movement (33%), which is led by a prominent Italian comedian (in the vein of political outsiders taking the helm).&nbsp;These two parties tried to form a majority-coalition recently, which is what was vetoed by the more establishment Italian President in power. (We&#39;re no experts on any of&nbsp;this - we&#39;re drawing primarily on the two above linked sources).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis recent veto could entail further snap elections, which would more or less mimic (though not directly reflect) a referendum on whether Italians want to stay in the E.U. If the third largest E.U. economy&#39;s population indicates it wants out (<em>Quitaly </em>is what tongue-in-cheek observes are calling it), the implications for economic stability in Europe and globally would be profound. That&#39;s what markets are trying to price in now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners, said it best: Italy is a &quot;market that is totally in panic.&quot; He also noted &quot;a total lack of confidence in the outlook for Italian public finances.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBelow you can see the response we&#39;ve gotten of recent in the Italian 2-year&nbsp;government bond&nbsp;yield. Italian debt sold off heavily, as evidenced in the meteoric rise in yield. (This has reversed somewhat today).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&#39;ll keep tabs on all these developments for you; the takeaway is that for now, global attention is fixated on Italian politics rather than U.S. dealings with North Korea and Iran. US stock indices are up again today, but we&#39;re not so sure these issues should be shrugged off. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/bd4db78a-4fea-47dc-94ef-a462e9ae8493.jpg" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:800px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:navy"><strong>All Pistons Firing? </strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">It should come as no surprise to you at this point; within the confines of these emails, and especially as it pertains to macroeconomic data, that we tend to lean a little bearish at this point in time.&nbsp;Secrets out. But hey, it&#39;s also no secret that we are almost a full decade into our current bull-market. Strictly from a temporal perspective, we imagine we&nbsp;should be towards the later stage of this cycle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur predilection certainly came at odds with the gargantuan gains the stock market saw in the first few months of our brief writing. We&#39;re not above saying it; we&#39;ve been <em>quite </em>early in pointing towards economic weakness. And insofar as a hypothesis is only as good as the timeframe it&nbsp;establishes, we were wrong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t want to continue to flag signs that our decade long bull market may be losing steam. Rather than opine at length, we&#39;ll take a peak at some actual data. Tracking changes in cyclical industries, such as the auto industry&nbsp;which we haven&#39;t tapped at length previously, seems like a decent place to start.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, let&#39;s quickly recap why we would refer to the auto industry as &quot;</span><span style="color:gray"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=e5b40df5e8&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">cyclical</span></a></span><span style="color:black">.&quot; Simply put, cyclical industries and business are those that exhibit higher than average sensitivity to business cycles (recessions and economic expansions). Given how much of an expense an auto purchase represents to the average consumer, car purchases are far more likely to be delayed during periods of economic recession when compared with other goods. The same can be said of most non-necessities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn any case, after peaking in 2014, retail sales of motor vehicles in the US have been in a steady downtrend since. See the below data from our good friend FRED:</span><span style="color:gray"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/97ef7e30-8bd9-4d0e-bbc2-2e9fb1e3d21d.png" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:1024px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">Similarly, consumers who are still proceeding with car purchases are relying on more and more lenient financing to make car purchases. Specifically, auto loans with longer terms (84 and 96 months) are becoming more and </span><span style="color:gray"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=7f857d1bb4&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">more common</span></a></span><span style="color:black">. This suggests that the consumer population that is still buying vehicles now, rather than later, is more strapped on a cash basis and has to reach for more lenient financing. Similarly, sensing decreases in demand for their lending services, lenders are getting more &quot;creative&quot; in terms of the financing they&#39;re offering.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTaken together, these two data points make us wonder whether the economy is running on fumes, or whether there&#39;s still plenty of gas in the tank.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, if you&#39;re more inclined to stationary biking - SoulCycle <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=4d124b0fd2&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">delayed their IPO last week</span></a>, citing &quot;market conditions.&quot; Um, market conditions? That&#39;s an extraordinarily vague excuse, but it is another small signal that all may not be well for businesses that rely on consumers&#39; disposable income. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:#000066"><strong>Neglected Tech</strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">While we, as usual, envision canaries croaking in coal mines, the NASDAQ especially is still running hot, rewarding investors who weren&#39;t deterred after the market sell offs in February and March. As of this writing, and despite Monday&#39;s Italian sell off, the NASDAQ had returned ~ 8% year-to-date. We haven&#39;t really heard that much discussion of this fact; if you just watched CNBC on a day to day basis you&#39;d think things were pretty gloomy.&nbsp;Even as the seasoned macroeconomic stalwarts at SoulCycle (yes we&#39;re joking) provide caution regarding &quot;market conditions,&quot; the tech sector is on pace for a double-digit gain this year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNowhere is this better visualized than in the ascendancy of the largest tech companies. Last week, the market capitalization (shares outstanding * share price) of Netflix passed Disney for the first time. These two companies are oft compared to one another because of the bloody battle they will likely be waging with each other for dominance in the media realm in the coming years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis isn&#39;t a case of apples to apples however. We don&#39;t need to educate you on the age and endurance of Disney as a company, and it also sports ~ </span><span style="color:gray"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=da7a40e97b&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">$9 Billion of Free Cash Flow</span></a></span><span style="color:black"> as a result of generations of consolidation.

That&#39;s a compound annual growth rate of 27% annually. We can&#39;t blame people for buying in given that type of growth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, valuing what users will ultimately be worth in terms of future free cash flow is a delicate art that we don&#39;t have the time to try to model out right now. Which would we choose? We&#39;d probably take the $9B of FCF that Disney churns out on an annual basis. But to each his own.
