We say <em>allowed</em> because it has been clear for the better part of a decade that the ECB, along with other central banks globally, are not prepared to make any serious attempts to unwind the balance sheets they&rsquo;ve accrued since the last financial crisis (that is, they can&#39;t sell the massive amounts of securities they bought to prop up asset prices post 2008).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&rsquo;s an excerpt from Draghi&rsquo;s <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=a0e948b6f6&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">remarks</span></a>:</span><span style="color:gray"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px"><span style="color:black"><em>&ldquo;The underlying strength of the euro-zone economy continues to support our confidence that inflation will converge to our...aim of...close to 2% over the medium term. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation remain subdued, and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend&hellip;&rdquo;</em></span><span style="color:gray"> </span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">Given Draghi&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;subdued&rdquo; measures of underlying inflation, the inevitable policy decision was to maintain levels of monetary stimulus without an interest rate increase. What&rsquo;s the net-net of this? More dragon energy for equity markets, though coupled with shaky growth, monetary stimulus may be playing more of a supporting rather than driving role in asset prices at this point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember, monetary stimulus (in this case, a continued QE bond-buying program) is intended to spur aggregate demand, which in turn&nbsp;cause an increase in the price level, and ultimately increases output, AKA GDP.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy now, we have talked about the potential adverse side effects of QE (Quantitative Easing, if the acronym is slipping in your mind) in regards to three central banks: the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and now the ECB. The risks of continued QE in the Eurozone are comparable to those we have outlined domestically.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor one, there&rsquo;s a risk of overshooting inflation targets; measures of underlying inflation aren&rsquo;t perfect and inflation could pick up quickly leaving insufficient time for tighter monetary policies to curb it. Similarly, the longer the ECB&rsquo;s monetary stimulus program continues, the more assets it will have on its balance sheet and the harder it will be to &ldquo;normalize&rdquo; policy down the road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt this rate, perhaps they never will. See below for a chart of the ECB&#39;s total assets over time, and contrast this with how the Fed has halted its QE programs:</span><span style="color:gray"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/e31ae476-7069-41f7-9bd6-06c6f32a56bc.png" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:758px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<span style="color:black">Paul Donovan, <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=d4d3edf17d&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">Global Chief Economist&nbsp;of UBS</span></a>, had the following thoughts:</span><span style="color:gray"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px"><span style="color:black"><em>&ldquo;The main point of interest at today&#39;s ECB press conference is what color tie ECB President Draghi will wear.

For one, WeWork is not profitable by any &lsquo;real&rsquo; measures (more on this below), and their expenses are set to balloon in the next 5 years when entry deals they struck on operating leases end and higher lease liabilities kick in. Nor do they own their properties; if they did these assets&nbsp;could provide collateral for bondholders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBloomberg&#39;s Matt Levine uses the following to describe&nbsp;WeWork&#39;s business model: &quot;It leases office space from regular real-estate companies, adds &hellip; beer? &hellip; or whatever, and then subleases the space to tenants at higher rates.&quot; Harsh? Maybe. Nonetheless, WeWork has managed to attain a $20B valuation despite the criticism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking of criticism, well, WeWork is attracting its fair share for its -- let&#39;s just say -- dubious accounting measures used to sweeten the picture for investors.&nbsp;The company recently disclosed an <em>odd</em> non-GAAP accounting measure, namely &ldquo;Community-Adjusted EBITDA&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEBITDA &ndash; aka earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (D&amp;A are both non-cash expenses), is a highly relevant financial metric that, amongst other uses, paints a picture of a company&#39;s operating profitability.&nbsp;But WeWork decided to add back all sorts of other costs to EBITDA in their &ldquo;Community-Adjusted EBITDA&rdquo; measure (AKA it tried to beef up its profitability). </span><span style="color:gray"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=a1173bac5c&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">Here&rsquo;s </span></a></span><span style="color:black">some more detail:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px"><span style="color:black"><em>&ldquo;WeWork&rsquo;s &lsquo;community adjusted Ebitda&rsquo; ignores basic expenses like general and administrative, marketing and development costs, which are usually considered critical for daily operations&hellip;&rdquo;</em></span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">Incidentally, adding back those big operational line items was the only way WeWork could report a positive earnings figure. An earnings metric that excludes general and administrative costs seems suspect. To offer another perspective though, there was some, albeit cautious, defense of the measure, <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=535b054075&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">here&#39;s</span></a> Matt Levine again, offering a slightly less caustic point:</span><span style="color:gray"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px"><span style="color:#222222">&ldquo;I am tempted to defend &lsquo;community adjusted Ebitda&rsquo; a little bit.&nbsp;Loosely speaking it is the amount of rent that WeWork&nbsp;gets paid minus the amount of rent (and other facility operating expenses) that it pays.&quot;</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">This is essentially the profit WeWork turns on a space-by-space basis, without including overall company expenses. Someday WeWork will need to account for these other costs though, and we&rsquo;ll be curious to see what their earnings look like then. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:black">Moody&rsquo;s, the credit rating&rsquo;s agency, agrees with our concern as they gave the bond issue a &ldquo;Deep Junk&rdquo; rating, or alternatively &ldquo;<a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=09891fb0b9&amp;e=07ec0df837" target="_blank"><span style="color:#00add8">seven steps into junk</span></a>&rdquo; (we&rsquo;re having fun with this, sorry).
