One problem with their existence is interwoven with the trend of passive investing.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nGiven that investors have put&nbsp;increasingly more&nbsp;money to work tracking indices rather than picking individual stocks in the last few years, there are fewer and fewer investors&nbsp;contributing analysis to market pricing. Less discriminate investors inevitably buy bundles of equity that include these zombie companies, which may well have been avoided had more due diligence been performed.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nRising short and intermediate term rates could be the twelve-gauge that cuts these zombies out of the economy for good, leaving passive investors scratching their heads. Felder pointed this out directly in his aforementioned article:<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine just how vulnerable these zombies might be to rising interest rates and waning risk appetites.&rdquo;</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">Still, other global macro analysts see the Fed&rsquo;s monetary tightening as less of a risk factor. For instance, Gene Frieda, PIMCO Global Strategist, opined that &ldquo;The Fed is more mature in its tightening cycle&rdquo; than has been conventional wisdom of late. Whereas there were predictions of 4 Fed rate hikes at times during this year, the broader market consensus has inched back to a 3 rate hike forecast.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nRegardless of just how tight credit conditions become, we see the historically disproportionate number of public companies with greater interest expense than earnings as evidence that passive investing may already have reached a level of application at which it is not counterbalanced by commensurate active analysis.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong><span style=\\\"color:navy\\\">Does the Bull Yield to the Curve?</span></strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">If you&rsquo;ve kept your ear to the ground in terms of the financial markets since our last brief, you&rsquo;ve probably heard some <a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=314616d9a0&amp;e=07ec0df837\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#00add8\\\">warning bells</span></a> sounded re: &ldquo;a flattening yield curve.&rdquo; Before we get too far ahead of ourselves here, let&rsquo;s talk about what the hell a <a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=e3e31bace2&amp;e=07ec0df837\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#00add8\\\">yield curve</span></a> is. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">In general, a yield curve simply plots the yields of debt securities (y axis) against their maturities (x axis). The yield curve we will be concerning ourselves with today is the <a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=6451430d19&amp;e=07ec0df837\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#00add8\\\">U.S. treasury yield curve</span></a>, but yield curves can be constructed for any security with cash flows.&nbsp; </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">Typically, as you move from shorter to longer term maturities, yields increase:</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">Yields reflect a required rate of return; as the maturity of a debt security increases, so too does both its market price risk (the risk that its value will change due to changes in the credit of its issuer, inflation expectation, etc&hellip;) and its reinvestment risk if the debt security pays coupons (the risk that coupons received can&rsquo;t be reinvested at the same rate of return or at a higher one).</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">Given this set up, it should make sense that longer maturities typically equate to higher market and reinvestment risk, and thus higher required rates of return. Yield curves are thus usually upward sloping, reflecting a direct relationship between maturity and yield. Their &ldquo;steepness&rdquo; or slope however can vary considerably. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">Let&rsquo;s have a look at the treasury yield curve (per S&amp;Ps Capital IQ):</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img id=\\\"_x0000_i1025\\\" src=\\\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/5c858bdd-ffd2-4524-b929-8f54ffaa9e9e.png\\\" style=\\\"border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:515px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:515px\\\" /></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">While the curve retains some of its steepness between the 1, 2, and 5 year maturities, it is quite flat in historical terms and as visualized, especially between the 5-year and 30-year maturities. What investors fear when the Treasury yield curve flattens significantly is that the yield curve will actually <em>invert</em> in certain spots. An inversion would occur at any point on the yield curve where maturity and yield take on an inverse relationship rather than a direct one.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nIn order for there to be an inversion in the yield curve, demand for longer term maturities would have to exceed that for shorter maturities. For instance, as demand for the 10-year increases, prices increase, and yields (inversely related to price) will fall. If there&rsquo;s strong demand for the 10-year but not for the 5-year, the <em>spread</em> &ndash; aka the difference between the yield of the two maturities &ndash; will narrow. Inversions indicate a lack of investor confidence in the nearer-date maturities, which is a sort of proxy for a lack of confidence in the nearer-term economic outlook.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe below chart depicts this exact phenomenon as it is happening at current. It shows the 5-year US Treasury (maroon) and 10-year US Treasury (purple) yields, with data spanning the last decade. Note that while the yields (rate) tend to move together, they do expand and contract in terms of their yield spread. As illustrated, the spread is very tight at current, and there&rsquo;s a risk the 5-year yield could eclipse the 10-year yield if the spreads tighten further. At current, the spread is only 15 basis points (.15%): the 5-year yield is at 2.67%, and the 10-year yield is at 2.82% (as of 4/16).</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img id=\\\"_x0000_i1025\\\" src=\\\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/91f04e0f-a412-461e-989d-e0318c80895f.png\\\" style=\\\"border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:515px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:515px\\\" /></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">The Fed itself has previously stated concern over how it&rsquo;s monetary policy might affect the yield curve. In December of 2017, the Dallas Fed&rsquo;s President, Robert Kaplan, provided the </span><span style=\\\"color:gray\\\"><a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=db350ad3be&amp;e=07ec0df837\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#0000ff\\\">following</span></a></span><span style=\\\"color:black\\\"> on the possibility of interest rate increases potentially causing a yield curve inversion:</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">&ldquo;It limits the Fed&rsquo;s operating flexibility, in my judgment, in terms of how fast and how much we can raise rates&hellip;The history of inversions is such that it has tended to be a pretty reliable forward indicator of recession. Now, this time may be different, but I wouldn&rsquo;t count on it.&rdquo; </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">As noted by Kaplan, yield flattening can be driven primarily by the Fed&rsquo;s tightening of monetary policy; when the Fed raises the federal funds rate, short-term interest rates are often affected more readily than longer term rates. This can explain yield curve flattening and doesn&rsquo;t necessarily portent recessionary economic conditions <em>provided</em> the Fed&rsquo;s actions are appropriate responses to current economic conditions and won&rsquo;t exert <em>too </em>much pressure on borrowers (vis-&agrave;-vis those zombies we discussed earlier).</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">That&#39;ll be it for us today, we hope you enjoyed our more digestible format.

One problem with their existence is interwoven with the trend of passive investing.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nGiven that investors have put&nbsp;increasingly more&nbsp;money to work tracking indices rather than picking individual stocks in the last few years, there are fewer and fewer investors&nbsp;contributing analysis to market pricing. Less discriminate investors inevitably buy bundles of equity that include these zombie companies, which may well have been avoided had more due diligence been performed.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nRising short and intermediate term rates could be the twelve-gauge that cuts these zombies out of the economy for good, leaving passive investors scratching their heads. Felder pointed this out directly in his aforementioned article:<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine just how vulnerable these zombies might be to rising interest rates and waning risk appetites.&rdquo;</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">Still, other global macro analysts see the Fed&rsquo;s monetary tightening as less of a risk factor. For instance, Gene Frieda, PIMCO Global Strategist, opined that &ldquo;The Fed is more mature in its tightening cycle&rdquo; than has been conventional wisdom of late. Whereas there were predictions of 4 Fed rate hikes at times during this year, the broader market consensus has inched back to a 3 rate hike forecast.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nRegardless of just how tight credit conditions become, we see the historically disproportionate number of public companies with greater interest expense than earnings as evidence that passive investing may already have reached a level of application at which it is not counterbalanced by commensurate active analysis.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong><span style=\\\"color:navy\\\">Does the Bull Yield to the Curve?</span></strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">If you&rsquo;ve kept your ear to the ground in terms of the financial markets since our last brief, you&rsquo;ve probably heard some <a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=314616d9a0&amp;e=07ec0df837\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#00add8\\\">warning bells</span></a> sounded re: &ldquo;a flattening yield curve.&rdquo; Before we get too far ahead of ourselves here, let&rsquo;s talk about what the hell a <a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=e3e31bace2&amp;e=07ec0df837\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#00add8\\\">yield curve</span></a> is. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">In general, a yield curve simply plots the yields of debt securities (y axis) against their maturities (x axis). The yield curve we will be concerning ourselves with today is the <a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=6451430d19&amp;e=07ec0df837\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#00add8\\\">U.S. treasury yield curve</span></a>, but yield curves can be constructed for any security with cash flows.&nbsp; </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">Typically, as you move from shorter to longer term maturities, yields increase:</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">Yields reflect a required rate of return; as the maturity of a debt security increases, so too does both its market price risk (the risk that its value will change due to changes in the credit of its issuer, inflation expectation, etc&hellip;) and its reinvestment risk if the debt security pays coupons (the risk that coupons received can&rsquo;t be reinvested at the same rate of return or at a higher one).</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">Given this set up, it should make sense that longer maturities typically equate to higher market and reinvestment risk, and thus higher required rates of return. Yield curves are thus usually upward sloping, reflecting a direct relationship between maturity and yield. Their &ldquo;steepness&rdquo; or slope however can vary considerably. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">Let&rsquo;s have a look at the treasury yield curve (per S&amp;Ps Capital IQ):</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img id=\\\"_x0000_i1025\\\" src=\\\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/5c858bdd-ffd2-4524-b929-8f54ffaa9e9e.png\\\" style=\\\"border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:515px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:515px\\\" /></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">While the curve retains some of its steepness between the 1, 2, and 5 year maturities, it is quite flat in historical terms and as visualized, especially between the 5-year and 30-year maturities. What investors fear when the Treasury yield curve flattens significantly is that the yield curve will actually <em>invert</em> in certain spots. An inversion would occur at any point on the yield curve where maturity and yield take on an inverse relationship rather than a direct one.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nIn order for there to be an inversion in the yield curve, demand for longer term maturities would have to exceed that for shorter maturities. For instance, as demand for the 10-year increases, prices increase, and yields (inversely related to price) will fall. If there&rsquo;s strong demand for the 10-year but not for the 5-year, the <em>spread</em> &ndash; aka the difference between the yield of the two maturities &ndash; will narrow. Inversions indicate a lack of investor confidence in the nearer-date maturities, which is a sort of proxy for a lack of confidence in the nearer-term economic outlook.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe below chart depicts this exact phenomenon as it is happening at current. It shows the 5-year US Treasury (maroon) and 10-year US Treasury (purple) yields, with data spanning the last decade. Note that while the yields (rate) tend to move together, they do expand and contract in terms of their yield spread. As illustrated, the spread is very tight at current, and there&rsquo;s a risk the 5-year yield could eclipse the 10-year yield if the spreads tighten further. At current, the spread is only 15 basis points (.15%): the 5-year yield is at 2.67%, and the 10-year yield is at 2.82% (as of 4/16).</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img id=\\\"_x0000_i1025\\\" src=\\\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/91f04e0f-a412-461e-989d-e0318c80895f.png\\\" style=\\\"border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:515px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:515px\\\" /></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\\\"><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">The Fed itself has previously stated concern over how it&rsquo;s monetary policy might affect the yield curve. In December of 2017, the Dallas Fed&rsquo;s President, Robert Kaplan, provided the </span><span style=\\\"color:gray\\\"><a href=\\\"https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=db350ad3be&amp;e=07ec0df837\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#0000ff\\\">following</span></a></span><span style=\\\"color:black\\\"> on the possibility of interest rate increases potentially causing a yield curve inversion:</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:black\\\">&ldquo;It limits the Fed&rsquo;s operating flexibility, in my judgment, in terms of how fast and how much we can raise rates&hellip;The history of inversions is such that it has tended to be a pretty reliable forward indicator of recession. Now, this time may be different, but I wouldn&rsquo;t count on it.&rdquo; </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">As noted by Kaplan, yield flattening can be driven primarily by the Fed&rsquo;s tightening of monetary policy; when the Fed raises the federal funds rate, short-term interest rates are often affected more readily than longer term rates. This can explain yield curve flattening and doesn&rsquo;t necessarily portent recessionary economic conditions <em>provided</em> the Fed&rsquo;s actions are appropriate responses to current economic conditions and won&rsquo;t exert <em>too </em>much pressure on borrowers (vis-&agrave;-vis those zombies we discussed earlier).</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\">That&#39;ll be it for us today, we hope you enjoyed our more digestible format.
