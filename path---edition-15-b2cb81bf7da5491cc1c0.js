Where have all the public companies gone?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:#000000">Equity Universe Anemia</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The total number of public equities in the US is at its lowest level in three decades. At 3,267 stocks (per U Chicago&rsquo;s </span><a href="http://www.crsp.com/"><span style="color:blue">CRSP</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> data), today&rsquo;s US equity market has half the potential equity investments that it did 20 years ago. This market tidbit was revealed by Jefferies </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/01/market-shrinkage-fewest-us-stocks-since-1984.html"><span style="color:blue">last week</span></a><span style="color:#000000">: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">&quot;Between the lack of IPO activity, the pickup of M&amp;A, and buybacks, the U.S. equity world is becoming smaller and smaller&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The above delineates that even in our cheap debt environment, in which corporate transaction activity should pick up, companies are primarily choosing transactions that combine forces through Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A), as opposed to stand-alone transactions by which private companies go public. Understandably, when public companies merge together or acquire each other without a commensurate number of private companies going public, the number of public firms decreases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">See the below chart for a visualization of aggregate value of M&amp;A activity in the US since 2013. Activity increased steadily as the economy strengthened over the last four years, but M&amp;A volume has also waned as of late:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><img alt="M&amp;A vol" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=998c65c245&amp;view=fimg&amp;th=16225aa572da003b&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=emb&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ9lUQbnQ4oA1NXu6DxKY3V278GU6y2zWnEX4kQ2f21-dXBhKDfD40SOiRU_bZ9Fu_BWAiESOsvzrQo_UAs_qosZwhtqWiUwW-9EZDbdl9RMWZircCUC6oppG6I&amp;sz=w1052-h754&amp;ats=1521513204529&amp;rm=16225aa572da003b&amp;zw&amp;atsh=1" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">(Cap IQ)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=35251883&amp;privcapId=22401937"><span style="color:blue">DeSanctis</span></a><span style="color:#000000">, the analyst at Jefferies, goes on to mention that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&quot;</span><span style="color:#000000">Companies may not want to come public due to the additional cost of Sarbanes-Oxley or the fact that the private market has become a bigger source of financing than it has been in the past.&quot;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act"><span style="color:blue">Sarbanes-Oxley</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> is a federal law that was enacted in 2002 post-</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron"><span style="color:#0563c1">Enron</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> debacle. It expanded requirements for public company transparency and oversight, especially in regard to board and management requirements. It also heightened both compliance costs and individual responsibility for company stakeholders in public companies. All of the above are potential disincentives for private companies considering going public. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">This all begs another question: are there still companies in the pipeline that we might expect to IPO and go public? To better gauge this question, let&rsquo;s look at venture capital and private equity funding levels.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/alternative-investments/venture-capital-investing-stages.asp"><span style="color:#1155cc">Venture capital</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> (VC) funding is the process through which young companies or startups (generally referred as companies from the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seedcapital.asp"><span style="color:#1155cc">seed</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> or pre-seed stage to growth stage) receive capital. Private equity is a broad term for the funding of more mature companies (generally the growth stage and beyond) that are still private. Funding in these stages (specifically VC) serves not only as a barometer of the economy but also as an indicator of how many companies are looking to go public. Some refer to this as the IPO pipeline.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">VC funding, which peaked during the dot com boom of the late 90s and early 2000s, has steadily increased again since the great recession. In 2017, private funding steadily increased and is approaching dot com levels. This </span><a href="https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2018/01/venture-pulse-report-q4-17.pdf"><span style="color:#1155cc">KPMG</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> report notes the highest levels of VC funding in a decade &mdash; $155B in 2017. But how is this money being allocated? Is it going to thousands of seed stage companies in some kid&rsquo;s dorm, or a handful of massive private companies that are larger than most public companies?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The data indicates the latter. Q4 2017 saw six $1B + funding rounds with fewer total deals overall. This means that fewer and fewer startups are receiving funding; the ones that do are receiving an increasingly large portion of VC and private equity pie. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Uber is a classic example &mdash; it raised a $1.3B funding round just last December. This is a stand-in example of massive, private companies (usually tech companies that the layperson is familiar with: Lyft, Uber, Airbnb, etc.) delaying their entry into the public markets. Instead, they raise capital privately for longer. This contributes to the aforementioned phenomenon by virtue of which we are seeing fewer and fewer publicly-traded American companies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">We can see the same trend viewed through a different lens: by looking at &ldquo;money out.&rdquo; VC and private equity investors invest in companies (aka put &ldquo;money in&rdquo;) with the aims that they&rsquo;ll receive a higher return when a company exits (goes public or gets acquired usually). This second stage, when VC and PE firms get money back on their investments, refers to &ldquo;money out.&rdquo; </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Because companies are staying private longer, the &ldquo;money out&rdquo; levels are low compared to historical standards. Again, this reiterates the fact that fewer companies are going public today.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">What&rsquo;s the net-net of all this?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">For me and you, life doesn&rsquo;t change much. It simply means that we can&rsquo;t buy equity or debt in high-growth companies like Uber for the time-being (at least not as easily).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Meanwhile, for investing professionals in the public markets, the job becomes a bit harder. Given that active investing strategies depend on being able to find over and undervalued stocks, a smaller and continuously declining selection pool acts as an additional drag on this already challenging task of individual stock selection. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:#000000">Continued Discussion of Fundamental Analysis &amp; Discounting Free Cash Flow</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">We hope we didn&rsquo;t fully deter you from active investing strategies over the past few weeks. We did indeed provide caution, and we outlined the difficulty of this task. But we want to discuss the processes by which you </span><em><span style="color:#000000">can </span></em><span style="color:#000000">arrive at actionable, sound investment theses. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">So, Mark &amp; Nick, where would you start a fundamental analysis of an equity, and where would you hope to end up? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The first place an analysis of equity should begin lies in an understanding of the company&rsquo;s business model and industry. Business models and relevant metrics on which to evaluate companies differ drastically across industries. Consider the differences between an investment bank, an airline, and a large retailer:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:48px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">At a granular level, a common measure of growth for retailers is focused on </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/targets-same-store-sales-beat-estimates-2018-03-06"><span style="color:blue">same-store sales</span></a><span style="color:#000000">, as this excludes growth contingent on new store openings. In contrast, airlines measure efficiency by comparing </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue-per-available-seat-mile-rasm.asp"><span style="color:blue">revenue per available seat mile (RASM)</span></a><span style="color:#000000">. These are clearly not measures of growth or sales we can employ across all industries, let alone to investment banks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Once you have a better understanding of what trends and measures are salient in the industry within which a company operates, and once you understand past performance of the company itself, you can look to model out future company performance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The most common valuation technique in the equity universe is the </span><a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-discounted-cash-flow-model.htm"><span style="color:blue">discounted cash flow model</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> (DCF). A DCF is aimed at determining the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp"><span style="color:#1155cc">present value</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> of a firm&rsquo;s </span><em><span style="color:#000000">future</span></em><span style="color:#000000"> cash flows. Remember, when you invest in a company&rsquo;s equity, you are hoping to receive future cash payments in the form of dividends. A quick definition:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:48px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:#000000">Free cash flow</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:#000000">(FCF)</span></strong><span style="color:#000000"> &ndash; the cash leftover to a company after it has bought, fixed, or improved its assets in a given period. In other words, this is cash that is available for </span><em><span style="color:#000000">discretionary purposes</span></em><span style="color:#000000">. It could be used for further investment in assets, it could be used to pay off debt, or it </span><em><span style="color:#000000">could be distributed to shareholders</span></em><span style="color:#000000">. This is the measure we will want to forecast prospectively in our DCF.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">The starting point for performing this analysis is in analyzing a firm&rsquo;s balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement (the </span><a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/three-financial-statements/"><span style="color:blue">three major financial statements</span></a><span style="color:#000000">). The goal of the accounting analysis is to understand how free cash flow is generated at current, and what insights about future cash flow we can glean from the company&rsquo;s current financial position. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">We don&rsquo;t have the time to do a significant deep dive on accounting right now, nor do we think you would enjoy it per se. But we will provide an overview of the DCF no less. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:#000000">The DCF:</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">By looking at past cash flow statements and then interpreting the current market environment and researching industry trends, an investor will try to estimate an accurate growth (or decline) rate for a firm&rsquo;s free cash flow. The following is our 5 step breakdown for the DCF:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal">\r\n\t<li>The determined growth rate is applied to current FCF (after potential accounting adjustments) to model a <em>future</em> stream of cash flows.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">\r\n\t\t<li>An advanced model might scale down growth rates overtime, or even include an inflection point to change a growth rate to decline or turn negative in later years</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>The FCF stream is then <em>discounted </em>back to present value\r\n\t<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">\r\n\t\t<li>This strips out the time value from the cash flow stream</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of this as an apples-to-apples comparison; $100 in 2030 is worth a lot less to you then than it would be right now &ndash; not just because of the inflation we will likely experience &ndash; but because of opportunity costs</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol start="3" style="list-style-type:decimal">\r\n\t<li>The sum of these present values (which we call Net Present Value) represents total expected cash flows in current dollars. This sum (NPV) gets added to current net cash for a total cash value.\r\n\t<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">\r\n\t\t<li>Any of the above calculations can easily be done in Excel</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Dividing the NPV by the number of shares outstanding results in a per share valuation</li>\r\n\t<li>This per share valuation is then compared to market price to hunt for potential deviations</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">One important detail not included above is what discount rate to use when discounting FCF to present value. It is often useful to use the firm&rsquo;s weighted average cost of capital. This is a crucial concept in and of itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:48px; margin-right:0px"><a href="about:blank"><span style="color:blue">Weighted average cost of capital</span></a><span style="color:#000000"> (WACC) refers to what it costs companies to raise money (remember, it&rsquo;s not just start-ups that do this) per their capital structure. We won&rsquo;t dive into the calculation for this, but as an example, if a firm utilizes a mix of 50% debt and 50% equity when raising money, we would calculate their WACC as .5 * (cost of equity) + .5 * (</span><a href="about:blank"><span style="color:blue">cost of debt</span></a><span style="color:#000000">). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Why do we discount by WACC? Consider it a measure of opportunity cost for a firm; if a company has a WACC of 8%, they could achieve at least an 8% return on cash by retiring debt and buying back equity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">We hope all of this has resonated with you in some capacity. We know this material seems quite involved at first, but as you immerse yourself in it, these topics offer entirely new lines of inquiry. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:#000000">Acting on a Fundamental Analysis Conclusion</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">If you perform a DCF valuation, you might indeed calculate a per share price that is different from the market price. It&rsquo;s important to remember that when you value a company&rsquo;s equity, you should find the stock to be close to fair value </span><em><span style="color:#000000">most of the time</span></em><span style="color:#000000">. If you routinely reach valuations that are substantially off from market price, you may need to re-calibrate your process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Whether you find an equity to be overvalued or undervalued, there are many ways to try to profit from such a conclusion. The simplest course of action however, which also provides the investor with an unlimited investment horizon, is to buy equity that is undervalued or sell-short equity that is overvalued. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Most of us will be familiar with what buying stock entails. However, selling a stock short (&ldquo;shorting&rdquo;) is conventionally made out to seem a lot more complicated than it really is. The mechanics of the process are as follows: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">You borrow a stock from someone who owns it. </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">You then sell the stock you borrowed to someone at the market price, let&rsquo;s say $50.</span>\r\n\t<ul style="list-style-type:circle">\r\n\t\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">If your investment thesis is right, and the stock moves down to $40, you can buy it back at the lesser price, and return it to the person you borrowed it from, netting the $10 difference in this instance. </span></li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:#000000">Bonus Content: </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">There is also a way to profit if you are confident that an equity </span><em><span style="color:#000000">is fairly priced</span></em><span style="color:#000000"> and that the share price won&rsquo;t move much in the short-term. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">Namely, you can sell out-of-the-money options on the equity. What the hell does that mean? Here&rsquo;s the disambiguation, we&rsquo;ll use Snapchat ($SNAP) as an example: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">As of this writing:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">$SNAP trades at ~ $17.50</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">A call option on $SNAP with a $20 strike price and a 05/18/18 expiration costs ~ $115</span>\r\n\t<ul style="list-style-type:circle">\r\n\t\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">If $SNAP trades at $21 on or before the expiration date, the call option will be worth $100: (21-20 * 100 shares) </span></li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style="list-style-type:none">\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">In general, this call option will gain value as $SNAP rises above $20</span></li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style="list-style-type:none">\r\n\t<ul style="list-style-type:circle">\r\n\t\t<li><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000">Expiration date is the option term &ndash; the option will not exist after May 18</span><span style="color:#000000">th</span></li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">To profit in this scenario, given that the investor believes the price of $SNAP will not change, the investors </span><em><span style="color:#000000">sells</span></em><span style="color:#000000"> the option and receives a $115 credit. Provided $SNAP still trades around $17.50 in May, the option will be worthless to the buyer, and the seller will be off the hook for any potential option liability. The seller of the option nets the $115 credit less transaction costs. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">There is however unlimited risk in this scenario. If Snapchat happens on a cure for cancer and the price goes to $1000, the option seller owes the option buyer (1000-20) * 100 for a loss of $98,000. Option trades are zero sum; if you&rsquo;re on the wrong side of a trade as a seller, you owe your counterparty however much their option is worth. Seller beware.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="color:#000000">That&rsquo;s it for us today!
