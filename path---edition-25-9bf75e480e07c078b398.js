For reference, the annual deficit was closer to the -4% of GDP level last year (see below). Specifically, Goldman said the fiscal outlook for the US is &quot;not good.&quot; Even as we highlighted gains in the dollar over the last month recently, eventually deficit concerns may weigh on the dollar again. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/e0901a34-1284-466b-a3b0-04e9151efe6d.jpg" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:664px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">Below we add&nbsp;another neat visualization of country-by-country contributions to the global fiscal debt:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black"><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/87107be9-7248-48b6-adad-9c4bd25b543d.jpg" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:600px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><strong><span style="color:navy">Risk Watch</span></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="color:black">Headed to Vegas for Memorial Day? If not, don&#39;t fear, there&#39;s plenty of risk in the financial sector to satisfy your gambling itch. Concurrent with the <a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=acdcab57e2&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#656565">significant&nbsp;loosening </span></a>of&nbsp;Dodd-Frank baking sector regulations, data about the level of accumulating risk in financial markets continues to pour in, frequently leaving us scratching our heads a bit. </span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">To preface this line of analysis, we need to briefly re-introduce the concept of bond covenants. When entities issue bonds to raise funds, their creditors often look for specific contingent protections, namely <em><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=087e42a43d&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:#656565">covenants</span></a>,</em> that specify actions the issuing entity must perform or actions the issuer is expressly prohibited from engaging in. Covenants can take many forms, such as prohibitions against using assists pledged as collateral for one bond issue from being re-collateralized for other bond issues or restrictions on&nbsp;additional borrowing in general. Similarly, affirmative covenants might state simply that the issuer promises to make timely payments per the bond - aka, they promise not to default on the issue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&#39;re bothering with definitions here so that the below can be more digestible. Bonds can be classified by the quality of protection their covenants offer creditors (bond buyers). Bonds that are relatively <em>looser </em>in terms of their covenant protections for creditors are often termed &quot;covenant-lite&quot; or just &quot;cov-lite&quot; (now we&#39;re craving a Miller lite, for the first time ever). One measure of risk in markets broadly arises when&nbsp;the credit&nbsp;market is analyzed to see what percentage of bonds and loans are cov-lite. As it turns out, almost all loans these days are cov-lite:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black"><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/581fba39-fba8-49b7-b88f-28420eae7a5e.jpg" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:1180px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">Similarly, the level of overall leverage in the US market is at all-time highs. Loosely, </span><span style="color:#656565"><a href="https://siyucapital.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1&amp;id=a7d52dcbfe&amp;e=9a010449de" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">leverage</span></a></span><span style="color:black"> just refers to the extent to which investments are financed with borrowing. Hopefully this isn&#39;t a surprise, but&nbsp;many, if not most,&nbsp;investors borrow to try to amplify their returns. However, insofar as leverage can amplify returns, it also amplifies losses, and is often seen as a further arbiter of &quot;riskiness&quot; in markets as a result. We&#39;ll discuss leverage in much greater depth another time, next week perhaps, but for now we provide the below to chart, which illustrates current levels of leverage in the US stock market (not considering the&nbsp;far larger bond and derivative universes). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img id="_x0000_i1025" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fdc6c68021ff1ffb74a1c4fb1/images/7f15c898-5848-4507-9458-71e5d045fdfd.png" style="border-bottom-width:0in; border-left-width:0in; border-right-width:0in; border-top-width:0in; display:inline!important; height:auto; max-width:800px; outline:none; padding-bottom:0in; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:bottom; width:564px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="color:black">The takeaway? The higher the levels of risk, the harder&nbsp;any fall could be. Something something Icarus. We&#39;re certainly not in the business of making predictions about said <em>falls</em>, but then again, the Federal Reserve has never predicated a recession either. Stay safe out there.<em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="color:black">That&#39;ll be all for us today; short as promised.
