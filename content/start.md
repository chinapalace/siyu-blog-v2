##Hola Friends,

We hope everybody is having a wonderful day — we know we’re trying our best. Today we’ll start with some market updates and will then continue our ongoing consideration of market efficiency. We must again delay our discussion of discounted cash flows — something that we touched on last week briefly. We do however set ourselves up well to cover this next week, as we broach the idea of fundamental stock analysis at the end of today’s brief. Onwards and upwards, let’s dive in.

Market Happenings

**Cohn Out:**

S&P 500 futures were down ~ 1% in last night’s evening session in response to the news that Gary Cohn stepped down as Trump’s top economic advisor. FYI, we like to call market participants in the evening sessions “the pajama traders”. We present that tidbit strictly for your entertainment.

Cohn was indubitably seen as an ameliorative influence on the president’s occasionally erratic policy decisions. Trump’s desire to impose a tariff on foreign steel imports was clearly the last potential misstep Cohn wanted to deal with. We’ll see how markets digest this news during today’s session; things don’t look super positive as of 1pm eastern. Now, time to discuss those pesky tariffs that Cohn stormed out over.

**Tariffs and Trade Deficits:**

Tariffs have been all over the news lately as a result of President Trump’s threat to install tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Nick & Mark, is this good or bad, you may ask? Before making a judgement, it’s necessary to understand what a [tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff) is in its simplest form. But first, some wise words from the Commander in Chief:

“We have steel coming into our country from countries that don’t even know what steel is” ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-tariff-plan-strains-global-alliance-against-chinas-flood-of-metal-production-1520206665))

At a high level, a tariff is a tax on an import — meaning that Country T (T for tariff) charges a tax on a product, say steel, that Country S (S for steel) wants to sell in Country T. Post-tariff, the steel that comes into Country T is more expensive, and consumers within Country T are – depending on [elasticity of demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/priceelasticity.asp) – less likely to buy the good. Why does Country T do this?

For one, if Country T has domestic steel manufacturers, the steel produced by these manufacturers will now be relatively cheaper compared to foreign steel. The competitive position of domestic producers will thus be stronger. The most common reason for tariffs is to protect a domestic industry from being priced out of the market by a foreign country — in our example, consumers will adopt Country S’s steel if it is cheaper than Country T’s (assuming the quality is the same). Country T’s steel lobby is inclined to fight for a tariff if this is the case, specifically if it is the case that Country T does _not_ have any other competitive advantages (like the absence of a minimum wage and thus lower costs of production, for instance) in steel production. There are entire courses dedicated to the idea of competitive advantages, but [this](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp) overview will suffice for now.

Side note, there are many other potential reasons to implement tariffs; one frequent – and often highly necessary – use of tariffs arises when a country tries to protect a nascent domestic industry.

What are the results of our tariff example? Consumers in Country T are worse off in aggregate (their purchasing options have declined, and prices have gone up), the steel industry in Country T is better off (relatively stronger competitive position), and the steel industry in Country S is worse off (higher costs of goods sold). Generally, protectionism like this leaves _more_ parties worse off in aggregate. Tariffs, as well as taxes, create [deadweight losses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadweightloss.asp): declines in total market surplus which arise when market inefficiencies (in our case a tariff that distorts the interaction of supply, demand, and price) are introduced. Hence the reason that free international trade is — for the most part — trumpeted globally.

In the case of Trump’s proposal, the impetus for a steel tariff likely stems from a desire to protect the domestic steel/aluminum industries coupled with an attempt to combat China’s perceived overproduction and consequent dumping of metals. China accounted for 49% of global steel production capacity in 2016 (up from 15% in 2000). To use the words of the Wall Street Journal, China’s metals production has “[exploded](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-tariff-plan-strains-global-alliance-against-chinas-flood-of-metal-production-1520206665)” over the last decade, causing prices globally to drop precipitously.

While there is certainly an argument in favor of addressing the Chinese price advantage in metal production, the tariff move may end up having innumerable unintended consequences. Recent tariff threats have angered European countries (countries that, unlike the USA, rely on China for steel and aluminum), as they do not see tariffs as neither an effective nor a fair way of mitigating the effects of rampant global overproduction. Similarly, domestic industries that rely on steel as a primary input, for instance the auto industry, could suffer if and when steel prices climb.

Another major talking point surrounding the tariff discussion is our national [trade deficit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade_deficit.asp). A trade deficit simply means we import more goods than we export. The US happens to have a quite sizable [trade deficit.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/balance-of-trade) (Click this link later, after you play the game below in which we have you guess some countries’ trade balances).

Trade deficits can be measured in aggregate, but also between individual countries. As our trade deficit with China specifically is outsized, some argue that we need tariffs levied against Chinese imports to reverse at least a portion of the negative good flow. The below table outlines US trade in goods with China, with figures in millions of U.S. dollars.

However, we want to highlight that [“foreign import barriers and exports subsidies are not the reason for the US deficits](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-trade-deficit-inconvenient-truth-by-martin-feldstein-2017-04?barrier=accessreg)[.](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-trade-deficit-inconvenient-truth-by-martin-feldstein-2017-04?barrier=accessreg) [The overall trade deficit is the result of the saving and investment decisions of US households and businesses.](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-trade-deficit-inconvenient-truth-by-martin-feldstein-2017-04?barrier=accessreg)[”](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-trade-deficit-inconvenient-truth-by-martin-feldstein-2017-04?barrier=accessreg)

US exports do often face greater tariffs abroad; for instance – cars built in America [currently face a 10% tariff when they enter the EU, while vehicles shipped from Europe to the US are charged 2.5%](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/05/investing/trump-tariffs-european-cars/index.html). Still, it’s not these foreign tariffs that drive most of the US trade deficit. To dig into this, we present the following equation which holds in equilibrium:

**Exports – imports = private savings + government savings – domestic investment**

A deficit (imports > exports) must be offset by a commensurately negative sum of private and government savings less domestic investment. When both the US government and individual US consumers are taking on debt ([and lots of it](https://northmantrader.com/2018/02/28/debt-matters/)), a consequent trade deficit shouldn’t come as a surprise.

Lastly, we note that trade deficits in and of themselves aren’t inherently bad or good. [“](https://www.uschamber.com/series/above-the-fold/trade-deficit-truths)[In fact, a trade deficit is often a sign of economic good health, signaling that purchasing power is strong and consumers are optimistic enough to spend—just as we are seeing today.”](https://www.uschamber.com/series/above-the-fold/trade-deficit-truths) It’s when a country loses too much of its ability to produce key goods and services domestically, thereby also forfeiting jobs, that red flags crop up. Or when debt financing is jeopardized by rising rates and faltering credit quality of the debt issuer, as we discussed [two weeks](https://siyucapital.com/newsletters/13/)  ago.

We’ll end this section with a little game. We’ll provide a chart of trailing twelve-month aggregate national trade balances with the country names removed. See if you can guess some of the culprits. We’ll provide a breakdown at the end of the brief:

Informationally Efficient Markets

We now resume our discussion of whether and when markets are [informationally efficient](https://siyucapital.com/newsletters/13/).

**Per the CFA institute, an informationally efficient capital market is one in which the current price of a security fully, quickly, and rationally reflects all available information about that security.**

This definition brings in an important component of timeliness. Two weeks ago, when the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its last meeting, major market indices were up hundreds of points by the time Nick had downloaded the PDF from their website, even though his finger was on the trigger right at 2 p.m. eastern.

This should give you an inkling about the amount of algorithmic power that is pumped into parsing the fed minutes for tradable signs of the economic sentiment entailed in the reports. US markets are _scary quick_.

If markets were indeed 100% informationally efficient, there would be no utility to active investing. Passive investing in the broader stock and bonds markets – thus wagering on increases in aggregate stock and bond values over time – would theoretically outperform active trading strategies. (That is if you subscribe to the conventional _stocks go up over the long term_ theory)

Active trading strategies try to take advantage of over or under valuations in securities; when these opportunities don’t exist, trading costs reduce any expected value on active investing below that which can be captured with passive investing strategies.

Surprise! Markets are not 100% informationally efficient.

When Lehman Brothers went under in 2008, there were investors who saw, in the contents of the mortgage-backed-securities Lehman had on its balance sheet, the writing on the wall. Clearly the market was inefficient in its pricing of Lehman’s equity right until the stock went to zero. In order to take advantage of such opportunities however, investors must be prepared to do significant [fundamental analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) of any given equity.

Proper fundamental analysis requires dozens if not hundreds of hours of work, not to mention familiarity with the broader industry within which a company operates. It would be hubristic to assume that you, on a hunch, can more properly evaluate the fair price per share of a company, when there is already a marketplace of millions of investors who are buying and selling and thereby constantly forming and re-forming a broader market consensus based on the aggregate of their opinions, analysis, and sentiment.

This isn’t supposed to be an intimidation against investing; this should serve as an inspiration to dive deeper into the world of macroeconomics, accounting, corporate finance, market mechanics, etc…if you are so inclined.

This leads us to a cautionary example.

Your friend tells you about his oh-so-brilliant trade. He invested in a cobalt mining company, and has since enjoyed significant gains on his investment. His investment thesis, as he explains it to you, was that cobalt is an important material input in cell phone manufacturing (true). Given the ever increasing demand for cell phones and a limited global supply of cobalt, investing in cobalt mining companies is a great idea; their stock will rise in future years as cobalt becomes scarcer and therefore pricier.

Let’s assume that, by chance, your colleague actually managed to select a premier cobalt mining company that is publicly traded. Maybe he did some research. This ignores the risk that the stock of any random cobalt mining may only be somewhat correlated to the spot price of cobalt (as an example silver and gold mining companies’ equity never have correlations of 1 with the spot price of silver or gold, as the companies themselves carry risks for investors).

Nowhere in the investment thesis was there a consideration of why the company was _undervalued_ at current and thus represented a good buy. It is naive to think that market participants aren’t _exhaustively_ aware of cobalt’s status as an input in global technologies. Given informationally efficient markets, the current trading price of the equity of a cobalt mining or exploration company should almost _perfectly_ price in future forecast scarcities of the material. Equity prices always forecast _future_ cash flows to the company, they are _not_ reflective simply of the current state in time.

A more proper investment thesis would have to identify yet unconsidered, or improperly considered, strengths of the company in question. If you’re not intimately knowledgeable about [how cobalt is mined in the Congo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/batteries/congo-cobalt-mining-for-lithium-ion-battery/), you’re better of putting your money on red at the blackjack table in this case.

That’s it for us today. We hope you’re keeping your head above water as we head into spring. May your portfolios turn green as the landscape does too!

Mark + Nick
